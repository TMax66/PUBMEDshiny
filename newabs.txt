PRRS is one of the main viral diseases in pig production, causing huge economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. The virus shows an intrinsic genomic instability and is able to change continuously, with the emergence of new strains, with different pathogenicity patterns. Commercially available vaccines only partially prevent or counteract the disease and the correlated losses. Moreover, the emergence of highly virulent and pathogenetic isolates represents a particular concern for PRRS control and diagnosis. The purpose of this study was  to evaluate the efficacy of a modified-live virus (MLV) PRRSV-1 commercial vaccine in reducing the severity of the disease and minimizing losses upon challenge with a highly pathogenic PRRSV-1.1 Italian isolate (PRRSV-1_PR40/2014). Four different groups were compared: C (unvaccinated-uninfected), VAC-C (vaccinated-uninfected), PR40 (unvaccinated-infected) and VAC-PR40 (vaccinated-infected). The tested vaccine provided partial, but statistically significant clinical, virological and pathological protection after challenge under experimental conditions. In particular, vaccinated animals showed reduced viremia in terms of duration and magnitude, reduced respiratory signs and pathological lesions. Vaccination was able to trigger adaptive immunity able to respond efficiently also against the HP PR40 isolate. Vaccinated animals showed higher average daily weight gain, even during the viremic period, compared to non-vaccinated challenged pigs.  Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae and causes severe diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in seronegative newborn piglets. Thus, a precise and rapid diagnosis of PEDV infection is important for the application of control measures  to limit viral dissemination. In this investigation, a monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting  antibodies against PEDV was developed and validated. The diagnostic performance of the test was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using a panel of 829 known sera collected from different commercial pig farms, with or without a history of PED presence and from experimentally infected pigs.  The competitive ELISA showed excellent diagnostic performance and discriminatory  power with high sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) values (Se = 96.5%, 95% IC  94.1-98.1; Sp = 98.2%, 95% IC 96.3-99.3). Moreover, this competitive ELISA method has other properties, such as high feasibility of testing sera without pre-treatment and automatic and instrument-mediated revealing, that makes it appropriate for large-scale screenings of affected pig farms in endemic regions or for monitoring plans in PEDV-free areas.

The characterization of 72 Italian honey samples from 8 botanical varieties was carried out by a comprehensive approach exploiting data fusion of IR, NIR and Raman spectroscopies, Proton Transfer Reaction - Time of Flight - Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and electronic nose. High-, mid- and low-level data fusion  approaches were tested to verify if the combination of several analytical sources can improve the classification ability of honeys from different botanical origins. Classification was performed on the fused data by Partial Least Squares  - Discriminant Analysis; a strict validation protocol was used to estimate the predictive performances of the models. The best results were obtained with high-level data fusion combining Raman and NIR spectroscopy and PTR-MS, with classification performances better than those obtained on single analytical sources (accuracy of 99% and 100% on test and training samples respectively). The combination of just three analytical sources assures a limited time of analysis.  Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.05.084 	30381229

Dry and early lactation periods represent the most critical phases for udder health in cattle, especially in highly productive breeds, such as the Holstein Friesian (HF). On the other hand, some autochthonous cattle breeds, such as the Rendena (REN), have a lower prevalence of mastitis and other transition-related diseases. In this study, milk microbiota of 6 HF and 3 REN cows, all raised on the same farm under the same conditions, was compared. A special focus was placed on the transition period to define bacterial groups' prevalence with a plausible  effect on mammary gland health. Four time points (dry-off, 1 d, 7-10 d and 30 d after calving) were considered. Through 16S rRNA sequencing, we characterized the microbiota composition for 117 out of the 144 milk samples initially collected, keeping only the healthy quarters, in order to focus on physiological microbiome  changes and avoid shifts due to suspected diseases. Microbial populations were very different in the two breeds along all the time points, with REN milk showing a significantly lower microbial biodiversity. The taxonomic profiles of both cosmopolitan and local breeds were dominated by Firmicutes, mostly represented by the Streptococcus genus, although in very different proportions (HF 27.5%, REN 68.6%). Large differences in HF and REN cows were, also, evident from the metabolic predictive analysis from microbiome data. Finally, only HF milk displayed significant changes in the microbial composition along the transition period, while REN maintained a more stable microbiota. In conclusion, in addition to the influence on the final characteristics of dairy products obtained from milk of the two breeds, differences in the milk microbiome might, also, have an impact on their mammary gland health.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock affecting animal production and trade throughout Asia and Africa. Understanding FMD virus (FMDV) global movements and evolution can help to reconstruct the disease spread between endemic regions and predict the risks of incursion into FMD-free countries. Global expansion of a single FMDV lineage is rare but can result in severe economic consequences. Using extensive sequence data we have reconstructed the global space-time transmission history of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001  lineage (which normally circulates in the Indian sub-continent) providing evidence of at least 15 independent escapes during 2013-2017 that have led to outbreaks in North Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Far East and the  FMD-free islands of Mauritius. We demonstrated that sequence heterogeneity of this emerging FMDV lineage is accommodated within two co-evolving divergent sublineages and that recombination by exchange of capsid-coding sequences can impact upon the reconstructed evolutionary histories. Thus, we recommend that only sequences encoding the outer capsid proteins should be used for broad-scale  phylogeographical reconstruction. These data emphasise the importance of the Indian subcontinent as a source of FMDV that can spread across large distances and illustrates the impact of FMDV genome recombination on FMDV molecular epidemiology.

Mitogens are diverse compounds of plant and microbial origin, widely employed to  test immunocompetence in animals. The blastogenic response of bovine Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) to lypopolysaccharides (LPS) has been investigated in our laboratories for a long time. In particular, a possible correlation between blastogenic response to LPS and disease resistance of periparturient dairy cows had been observed in previous studies. Most important, low responder cows presented a higher frequency of disease cases after calving, compared with high responder animals. Owing to the above, different aspects of the blastogenic  response to LPS were investigated on PBMC of healthy Friesian cows, using a 72-hour Bromodeoxyuridin (BrDU) cell proliferation assay. Stimulation with LPS induced little if any replication of bovine PBMC over 72 hours despite consistent BrDU detection in all the PBMC samples under study. Poor replication of LPS-stimulated PBMC was confirmed by cell cycle and cell growth flow cytometry analyses. In particular, LPS stimulation gave rise to very low percentages of S phase cells, sometimes lower than in control, unstimulated cells, as opposed to Concanavalin A-stimulated PBMC. Magnetic separation and analysis of BrDU-treated  bovine PBMC after exposure to LPS showed that both B and CD4 T cells are involved in the blastogenic response to LPS, in contrast with current data based on human  and murine models. Finally, LPS caused an early, specific up-regulation of TNF-α  and TLR4 genes in bovine PBMC, and significant correlations were shown between the expression of inflammatory cytokine and Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) genes. On the whole, our data indicate that differences in the blastogenic response to LPS could be partly accounted for by heterogenicity of responding cells (B and T lymphocytes), which might also have an impact on induction and regulation of inflammatory responses and endotoxin tolerance.

The epidemiology of invasive listeriosis in humans appears to be weakly characterized in Poland, the sixth most populous member state of the European Union. We obtained antimicrobial susceptibility data, PCR-serogroups and genotypic profiles for 344 invasive isolates of Listeria monocytogenes, collected between 1997 and 2013 in Poland. All isolates were susceptible to the 10 tested antimicrobials, except one that was resistant to tetracycline and minocycline and harbored the tet(M), tet(A) and tet(C) genes. Overall, no increasing MIC values were observed during the study period. Four PCR-serogroups were observed: IVb (55.8%), IIa (34.3%), IIb (8.1%) and IIc (1.8%). We identified clonal complexes (CCs) and epidemic clones (ECs) previously involved in outbreaks worldwide, with  the most prevalent CCs/ECs being: CC6/ECII (32.6%), CC1/ECI (17.2%), CC8/ECV (6.1%) and CC2/ECIV (5.5%). The present study is the first extensive analysis of  Polish L. monocytogenes isolates from invasive infections.  DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-32574-0  PMCID: PMC6162231	30267005

Electronic address: mariabeatrice.boniotti@izsler.it.  There is currently an increased interest in the use of serological approaches in  combination with traditional cell-mediated immunity-based techniques to improve the detection of tuberculosis (TB)-infected animals. In the present study, we developed and validated two different serological TB-detection assays using four  antigens, MPB70, MPB83, ESAT6 and CFP10, and the tuberculin PPDb. A conventional  multi-antigen TB-ELISA method and a novel TB multiplex test, based on Luminex technology, were developed to detect antibodies to multiple antigen targets. The  performance levels of the two tests were evaluated and compared using selected panels of samples having known TB states. The TB-ELISA test (containing five antigens, including PPDb) had a sensitivity (Se) of 74.2% and a specificity (Sp)  of 94.9%, while the TB-Luminex test had higher Se (79.0%) and Sp (99.1%) rates even when only one reactive antigen was used to classify the test as positive. If a more restrictive criterion, requiring two positive antigens to classify the test as positive, was used, then the TB-ELISA's Sp rate increased to 99.8% but the Se decreased to 61.3%, while the TB-Luminex test's Sp rate increased to 100%  but the Se decreased to 51.2%. TB-ELISA and TB-Luminex were applied to a panel of 257 sera collected from bTB-positive herds, as determined by a post-mortem inspection. They showed good performance levels, identifying 49 (80.3%) and 48 (78.7%), respectively, of 61 samples that had tested positive by the intradermal  tuberculin (IDT) test and/or interferon-gamma assay. In addition, TB-ELISA and TB-Luminex were able to identify 60 and 42 samples as positive, respectively, out of the 196 samples that tested negative to IDT and interferon-gamma at the time of serum collection. Subsequent IDT tests performed after 1-2 months, confirmed the positivity of 18 samples, indicating the strategic value of having two serological assays to detect TB-infected herds that were not reactive to initial  IDT testing, thereby allowing for the rapid control of outbreaks and eradication  of the disease.

Resistance to new generation cephalosporins is an important public health problem globally, in terms of economic and social costs, morbidity and mortality. Βeta-lactamase enzymes are mainly responsible for the antibiotic resistance of Gram negative bacteria and extended-spectrum-β-lactamases (ESβLs) are one of the  major determinants of resistance against oxymino-cephalosporins in Enterobacteriaceae. Food-producing animals represent one of the sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria, including pigs. Here we analysed the presence of E. coli resistant to III generation cephalosporins isolated from different matrices collected from intensively bred pigs. A total of 498 E. coli were isolated from faeces and carcasses of pigs at slaughterhouse as well as from pork meat and sausages. Among these, 73 were phenotypically confirmed to be ESβL producers. Genetic analysis revealed that all except two harboured at least one of the three selected genes: blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV. Furthermore, six of the E. coli ESβL isolated from faeces and carcasses swabs, were also able to produce biofilm, highlighting the virulence potential of these strains. The presence of Multi-Drug-Resistance patterns (MDR) recorded by the 73 ESβL E. coli  was significant (60% of the strains were resistant to more than six antibiotics in MIC test). Results from the present study show that the transmission of resistant bacteria is possible along the food chain, including production of pork, one the most highly consumed meats around the world. Transmission is possible through the ingestion of raw meat products, and following cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods during preparation. The potential risk for human health demonstrated here, associated with the consumption of pork contaminated with bacterial strains characterized by multidrug resistance patterns, and the ability to produce ESβL and biofilm, is cause for concern. It is imperative to study future control strategies to avoid or limit as much as possible the transmission of these highly pathogenic strains  through food consumption and/or contact with the environment.

(#)Contributed equally  Nonstructural protein 2B of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus (FMDV) is comprised of a small, hydrophobic, 154-amino-acid protein. Structure-function analyses demonstrated that FMDV 2B is an ion channel-forming protein. Infrared spectroscopy measurements using partially overlapping peptides that spanned regions between amino acids 28 and 147 demonstrated the adoption of helical conformations in two putative transmembrane regions between residues 60 and 78 and between residues 119 and 147 and a third transmembrane region between residues 79 and 106, adopting a mainly extended structure. Using synthetic peptides, ion channel activity measurements in planar lipid bilayers and imaging  of single giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) revealed the existence of two sequences endowed with membrane-porating activity: one spanning FMDV 2B residues  55 to 82 and the other spanning the C-terminal region of 2B from residues 99 to 147. Mapping the latter sequence identified residues 119 to 147 as being responsible for the activity. Experiments to assess the degree of insertion of the synthetic peptides in bilayers and the inclination angle adopted by each peptide regarding the membrane plane normal confirm that residues 55 to 82 and 119 to 147 of 2B actively insert as transmembrane helices. Using reverse genetics, a panel of 13 FMD recombinant mutant viruses was designed, which harbored nonconservative as well as alanine substitutions in critical amino acid  residues in the area between amino acid residues 28 and 147. Alterations to any of these structures interfered with pore channel activity and the capacity of the protein to permeabilize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to calcium and were lethal for virus replication. Thus, FMDV 2B emerges as the first member of the viroporin family containing two distinct pore domains.IMPORTANCE FMDV nonstructural protein 2B is able to insert itself into cellular membranes to form a pore. This pore allows the passage of ions and small molecules through the membrane. In this study, we were able to show that both current and small molecules are able to pass though the pore made by 2B. We also discovered for the first time a virus with a pore-forming protein that contains two independent functional pores. By making mutations in our infectious clone of FMDV, we determined that mutations in either pore resulted in nonviable virus. This suggests that both pore-forming functions are independently required during FMDV infection.  Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.  DOI: 10.1128/JVI.01360-18 	30232178

This study describes the genetic characterization of serotype A viruses collected during outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) that occurred in Algeria in 2017. These are the first reports of clinical cases due to this serotype in the country since 1977. One complete genomic sequence (comprising 8,119 nucleotides)  and three additional near-complete genomic sequences were generated. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that these viruses were classified within the A/AFRICA/G-IV lineage, most closely related to viruses circulating in Nigeria between 2009 and  2015. These unexpected results motivate further studies to define the precise pathways by which this viral lineage has been introduced into North Africa in order to understand risks of future disease incursions into the region.  © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

Influenza D virus (IDV) was first reported in 2011 in swine in Oklahoma and consequently found in cattle, sheep, and goats across North America and Eurasia.  Cattle have been proposed as the natural reservoir. In this study, we developed and validated a MAb-based competitive ELISA for the detection of antibodies against IDV. Thirty-one hybridomas specific to IDV were generated using Balb/C mice immunised with purified IDV/Swine/Italy/199724-3/2015. The specificity of MAbs was determined by comparing their reactivity with the homologous and other influenza A viruses along with additional bovine and swine viruses. A solid-phase competitive ELISA (IDV-cELISA) was set up using the partially purified antigen coated to the plate and incubation of two serum dilutions (1/10 and 1/20) followed by addition of a peroxidase-conjugated MAb as competitor, which had shown wide intratype cross-reactivity and positivity in HI. To evaluate the diagnostic performances of IDV-cELISA, we used 884 sera (414 negative and 470 positive) from different species. ROC analyses were performed to enable the selection of best cut-off value and estimation of diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. The agreement between IDV-cELISA and HI test was assessed by Cohen's kappa value (κ). The κ analysis showed an almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.93; 95%CI -0.899 to 0.961) between HI test and IDV-cELISA. ROC analysis showed that IDV-cELISA was accurate with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.999, 95% CI 0.993-1.000). A cut-off value of 65% was selected with Se and Sp values of 99.35  (95% CI 98.1-99.9) and 98.75 (95% CI 97.1-99.6). These results proved excellent diagnostic performances of IDV-cELISA, which compared to HI presented major advantages, such as suitability for automation, low dependence on individual skills, spectrophotometric reading, and easy interpretation of the results. This  assay can be exploited to detect anti-IDV antibodies in different animal species.  © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.  DOI: 10.1111/tbed.13012 	30179314

Electronic address: hns@unife.it.  6-Aminonicotinamide (6AN) is an antimetabolite used to inhibit the NADPH-producing pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in many cellular systems, making  them more susceptible to oxidative stress. It is converted by a NAD(P)+ glycohydrolase to 6-aminoNAD and 6-aminoNADP, causing the accumulation of PPP intermediates, due to their inability to participate in redox reactions. Some parasites like Plasmodium falciparum and Coccidia are highly sensitive but not all cell types showed a strong responsiveness to 6AN, probably due to the different targeted pathway. For instance, in bacteria the main target is the Preiss-Handler salvage pathway for NAD+ biosynthesis. We were interested in testing 6AN on the kinetoplastid protozoan Leishmania as another model to clarify the mechanisms of action of 6AN, by using metabolomics. Leishmania promastigotes, the life-cycle stage residing in the sandfly, demonstrated a three order of magnitude higher EC50 (mM) compared to P. falciparum and mammalian cells (μM), although pre-treatment with 100 μM 6AN prior to sub-lethal oxidative challenge induced a supra-additive cell kill in L. infantum. By metabolomics, we did not detect 6ANAD/P suggesting that NAD+ glycohydrolases in Leishmania may not be highly efficient in catalysing transglycosidation as happens in other microorganisms. Contrariwise to the reported effect on 6AN-treated cancer cells,  we did not detect 6-phosphogluconate (6 PG) accumulation, indicating that 6ANADP  cannot bind with high affinity to the PPP enzyme 6 PG dehydrogenase. By contrast, 6AN caused a profound phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) decrease and nucleobases accumulation confirming that PPP is somehow affected. More importantly, we found  a decrease in nicotinate production, evidencing the interference with the Preiss-Handler salvage pathway for NAD+ biosynthesis, most probably by inhibiting the reaction catalysed by nicotinamidase. Therefore, our combined data from Leishmania strains, though confirming the interference with PPP, also showed that 6AN impairs the Preiss-Handler pathway, underlining the importance to develop compounds targeting this last route.

The acute course of disease in young oysters infected by OsHV-1 and the rapid tissue degradation often preclude histological examination of specimens collected during outbreaks in field. Herein, live spat originated from two geographical areas were sampled just at the onset of a mortality event that occurred in Normandy (France) in June 2016. The lesions, associated with high OsHV-1 DNA quantities, were characterized by severe and diffuse haemocytosis mainly involving blast-like cells, myocyte degeneration and large, irregularly shaped degenerate eosinophilic cells in the connective tissue. The herpesvirus was identified by negative staining TEM and real-time PCR. Sequencing of the C region and ORFs 42/43 confirmed that the variants met the definition of OsHV-1 μVar. We  sequenced 30 other ORFs in twenty OsHV-1-positive individuals and compared them to the μVar specimens isolated between 2009 and 2011. The ORFs encoding putative  membrane proteins showed the highest number of variations. Seven different genotypes were identified, confirming the presence of relevant genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for a well-separated μVar new group, with an evolutionary divergence estimated at 0.0013 from the other μVar variants. The  geographical distribution of these newly described variants and their effective virulence should be investigated in future.  © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.  DOI: 10.1111/jfd.12883 	30151980

Salmonella enterica serovar Napoli (serovar Napoli) is an emerging cause of human salmonellosis in Northern Italy. No specific reservoirs of serovar Napoli have been identified in Italy, so far. However, the environment, especially surface waters, has been hypothesized as an important source of infection based on the observation that genotypically different clusters of serovar Napoli are detected  in different geographical macro-areas. To further support the hypothesis of a spatially-restricted pattern of serovar Napoli diffusion, a spatial segregation of serovar Napoli lineages should be observed also at smaller geographical scale. However, classical genotyping techniques used for Salmonella, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), did not possess enough discriminatory power to highlight spatial clustering of serovar Napoli within the macro-areas. To this purpose, we performed phylogeographical analyses based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms to test whether spatio-temporal evolution patterns of serovar Napoli in Northern Italy could be recognized with high geographical resolution, i.e. at local level. Specifically, we analyzed the local spread of the main PFGE clonal group, responsible for more than 60% of human infections in the study area, that did not show any geographical differentiation  by PFGE within Northern Italy, i.e. the macro-area considered in the study. Both  discrete and continuous phylogeography highlighted the existence of two main geographically-restricted clades: a Southern clade corresponding to the Po Valley and a Northern clade corresponding to the Pre-Alps area. Furthermore, the phylogeographical analyses suggested that the most probable site of origin of the clone was in an area of the Po Valley at the confluence of the Po and Ticino rivers, one of the most important Italian wetlands. These findings provide further support to the hypothesis that environmental transmission may play an important role in the ecology of serovar Napoli.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) affects economically important livestock and is one  of the most contagious viral diseases. The most commonly used FMD diagnostic assay is a sandwich ELISA. However, the main disadvantage of this ELISA is that it requires anti-FMD virus (FMDV) serotype-specific antibodies raised in small animals. This problem can be, in part, overcome by using anti-FMDV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) as detecting reagents. However, the long-term use of MAbs may be problematic and they may need to be replaced. Here we have constructed chimeric antibodies (mouse/rabbit D9) and Fabs (fragment antigen-binding) (mouse/cattle D9) using the Fv (fragment variable) regions of a mouse MAb, D9 (MAb D9), which recognises type O FMDV. The mouse/rabbit D9 chimeric antibody retained the FMDV serotype-specificity of MAb D9 and performed well in a FMDV detection ELISA as well as in routine laboratory assays. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis confirmed engagement with antigenic site 1 and peptide competition studies identified the aspartic acid at residue VP1 147 as a novel component of the D9 epitope. This chimeric expression approach is a simple but effective way to preserve valuable FMDV antibodies, and has the potential for unlimited generation of antibodies and antibody fragments in recombinant systems with the concomitant positive impacts on the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) principles.

The Trypanosoma theileri group includes several trypanosome species hardly distinguishable due to the lack of discriminating morphological characters. Trypanosomes belonging to this group have been isolated from different bovine, ovine, and cervids in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Americas. The principal vectors of the T. theileri group are considered tabanid flies; however, T. melophagium is transmitted exclusively by sheep keds. In 2016, 128 sand flies out of 2,728 trapped in Valsamoggia municipality, Italy, were individually dissected and an unknown trypanosome strain, named TrPhp1, was isolated from a female of the sand  fly Phlebotomus perfiliewi. Sequence analysis placed this trypanosome in the T. theileri group with very high homology to other trypanosomes detected in European cervids. This is the first report of the T. theileri group isolation from a sand  fly, and the possible role of this insect group in the trypanosome transmission cycle is discussed. Within the T. theileri group, the phylogenetic analysis distinguished several lineages, which, unfortunately, do not correspond with their host specificity and their taxonomic status remains ambiguous.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy.  Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV) causes watery diarrhoea, dehydration, and a high mortality rate among suckling pigs. Recently, PEDV had a large negative economic impact on the swine industries in Asia and North America. In 2014, PEDV  re-emerged in many European countries, but most countries only reported a few sporadic cases. Here, we report the epidemic wave that occurred in Italy from 2015 to 2017. During this time, PEDV was detected by real-time PCR in 438 farms located mainly in the high-density pig production area in Northern Italy. Most of the outbreaks were in farrow-to-finish, farrow-to-wean and finisher farms. Clinical signs were observed mainly in suckling and fattening animals, while mortality rates were higher in piglets, reaching 50%. A sequence analysis showed  that a PEDV strain, similar to the OH851 S-INDEL strain isolated in the USA in January 2014, was responsible for the outbreaks in Italy in 2015 and 2016. However, from January 2017, a recombinant variant strain, containing a portion of the Swine Enteric Coronavirus in the S1 gene, spread and almost completely outcompeted the previous nonrecombinant strain. In total, 14.1% of the environmental swabs collected from trucks at slaughterhouses after animals were unloaded tested positive for PEDV before the trucks were cleaned and disinfected, and 46% remained positive after cleaning and disinfection processes were performed. Moreover, environmental swabs indicated that 17.3% of the empty trucks arriving at the farms to load animals were PEDV-positive. This study indicates that trucks can have an important role in the spread of PEDV in Italy.  © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.  DOI: 10.1111/tbed.12974 	30094946

Nevertheless, in 2014 a pod of 7 specimens stranded alive along the Italian coast of the Central Adriatic Sea: 3 individuals died on the beach after a few hours due to internal damages induced by prolonged recumbency;  the remaining 4 whales were refloated after great efforts. All the dead animals were genetically related females; one was pregnant. All the animals were infected by dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and the pregnant whale was also affected by a severe nephropathy due to a large kidney stone. Other analyses ruled out other possible relevant factors related to weather conditions or human activities. The  results of multidisciplinary post-mortem analyses revealed that the 7 sperm whales entered the Adriatic Sea encountering adverse weather conditions and then  kept heading northward following the pregnant but sick leader of the pod, thereby reaching the stranding site. DMV infection most likely played a crucial role in impairing the health condition and orientation abilities of the whales. They did  not steer back towards deeper waters, but eventually stranded along the Central Adriatic Sea coastline, a real trap for sperm whales.

During 2014-2015, in order to evaluate the  effectiveness of traditional cooking process, raw product (defrosted), sliced cooked portions cut through electric knife and assembled sandwich were officially sampled in kebab houses and in a local industrial kebab producer in Reggio Emilia (a province in Italy). Microbiological researches for safety and hygienic microbiological indicators were carried out (research of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli; enumeration mesophilic aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, sulfite-reducing bacteria growing under anaerobic conditions, yeasts and molds). Between the raw and the cooked product an average of 3 log reduction in mesophilic aerobic bacteria counts was observed. In two out of three kebab houses sampled, which were supplied by the same local industrial producer, the presence of L. monocytogenes was detected. During the official inspection carried out at the production plant a contamination of L. monocytogenes was assessed in both ambient and instruments. Furthermore, 3 lots of products were analyzed and all were found to be contaminated by L. monocytogenes (always above 100 CFU/g). In order to verify the capability of the traditional cooking process to reduce the risk of contamination at an acceptable level, a batch of naturally contaminated kebab (4.5 log CFU/g) was cooked and sliced simulating a day work activity in a kebab shop. The product was then sampled during preparation and enumeration of L. monocytogenes was obtained. After an hour of cooking, the residual contamination  was 1.8 log CFU/g, after two hours and a half L. monocytogenes was no longer detectable in the product, but half an hour later it was again detectable in 25g. At the end of the experiment, the contamination grown up to the same level enumerated after an hour of cooking (1.8 log CFU/g). Considering the microbiological results, traditional cooking obtained a rate of -2.40 log CFU/gh-1, a D=26 min that corresponds to a temperature of maximum 60°C (z=6). In  conclusion, our experiment demonstrates the traditional kebab cooking process could not always guarantee a complete product decontamination.

Fishing activities are considered one of the most relevant threats for cetaceans  and sea turtles conservation since these animals are sometimes found dead entangled in fishing gears. Currently, postmortem diagnosis is based mainly on the presence of nets and lines on the body and the related marks and injuries evident at gross examination. A more detailed and objective evidence is needed to clarify doubts cases and the diatoms technique, used in forensic human medicine,  could support drowning diagnosis also in this field. Diatoms' investigation was implemented to be applied in marine vertebrate on 8 striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) and 1 bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) dolphins and 5 sea turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded along the Italian coastlines with a likely cause of death hypothized on necropsies carried out by veterinary pathologists. Diatoms were microscopically searched in the bone marrow collected from long bones implementing protocols used in human medicine and their presence was observed in  4 cetaceans and 2 sea turtles. Despite a clear relation between diatoms' presence and amount and the likely cause of death was not proved due to the poor number of samples, the higher burden of diatoms was found in 3 animals deemed to be death for the interaction with human activity. Despite more studied are necessary to identify the possible relation between the cause of death and diatoms' findings,  the present study implemented this technique to be adapted to marine animals, confirming its possible application also in veterinary forensic medicine.

The recent outbreak of Salmonella Agona linked to the consumption of infant formula (powdered formula) has rekindled the attention about the correct procedures for preparation and use of these products. International guidelines have already been published so far, particularly in association with Cronobacter  sakazakii in early 2000s. FAO/WHO suggested to reconstitute formula with water at no less than 70°C. We therefore contaminated powdered formula with low levels of  Salmonella spp and C sakazakii to evaluate the pathogens inactivation during the  formula preparation using water at 70°C. In these conditions we observed a survival of both pathogens, indicating that the suggested recommendations may be  not enough to guarantee the safety of this product. Higher temperatures are needed to reduce the biological risk, even if it may be not easily realized in actual domestic conditions. Moreover, the impact on the nutritional value of reconstituted formulas should be evaluated.  DOI: 10.1097/MPG.0000000000002100  PMCID: PMC6155361	30024862

The study summarises the results obtained over the period 2002-2013 by the Italian IT-Enter-Vet network, aimed at collecting data on Salmonella isolates from non-human sources. A total of 42,491 Salmonella isolates were reported with  a progressive decrease over the years. S. Typhimurium was the most frequent serovar up to 2011, but then, it was overtaken by S. 4,[5],12,:i:-, S. Derby, S.  Livingstone and S. Enteritidis alternated as the third most commonly isolated serovars. With regard to the sources of isolation, S. Typhimurium was distributed ubiquitously among the animal species. On the contrary, S. 4,[5],12,:i:- and S. Derby were strictly associated with pigs, whereas S. Livingstone, S. Enteritidis  and S. Infantis were clearly related to poultry. Intriguingly, when the frequency of serovar distribution along the food chain was considered, it was evident that  S. Typhimurium and S. Derby tended to persist along the chain, as they were isolated even more frequently from foods than from animals. A similar distribution was found for S. Enteritidis and S. Hadar. Despite limitations related to non-mandatory participation of laboratories in the network, the data presented are valuable to obtain a picture of the evolution of Salmonella from non-human sources over time in Italy.  © British Veterinary Association (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum is an ongoing health problem in southern Europe, where dogs are considered the main reservoirs of the disease. Current data point to a northward spread of VL and canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Italy, with new foci in northern regions previously regarded as non-endemic. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) was performed to investigate genetic diversity and population structure of L. infantum on 55 samples from infected humans, dogs and sand flies of the E-R region between 2013 and 2017. E-R samples were compared with 10 L. infantum samples from VL cases in other Italian regions (extra E-R) and with 52 strains within the L. donovani complex. Data displayed significant microsatellite polymorphisms with low allelic heterozygosity. Forty-one unique and eight repeated MLMT profiles were recognized among the L. infantum samples from E-R, and ten unique MLMT profiles were assigned to the extra E-R samples. Bayesian analysis assigned E-R samples to two distinct populations, with further sub-structuring within each of them; all CanL samples belonged to one population, genetically related to Mediterranean MON-1 strains, while all but one VL cases as well as the isolate from the sand fly Phlebotomus perfiliewi fell under the second population. Conversely, VL samples from other Italian regions proved to be genetically similar to strains circulating in dogs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A peculiar epidemiological situation was observed in northeastern Italy, with the co-circulation of two distinct populations of L. infantum; one population mainly detected in dogs and the other population detected in humans and in a sand fly. While the classical cycle of CanL in Italy  fits well into the data obtained for the first population, the population found in infected humans exhibits a different cycle, probably not involving a canine reservoir. This study can contribute to a better understanding of the population  structure of L. infantum circulating in northeastern Italy, thus providing useful epidemiologic information for public health authorities.

Taurine (TAU) is a sulfur-containing beta amino acid that is not involved in protein composition and anabolism, conditionally essential in mammals provided through diet. Growing evidence supports a protective role of TAU supply in osmoregulation, calcium flux, and reduction of inflammation and oxidant damage in renal diseases like diabetes. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, due to abnormal  proteostasis, is a contributor to nephrotic syndrome and related renal damage. Here, we investigated the effect of dietary TAU (1.5% in drinking water for 15 days) in an established rat model that mimics human minimal change nephrosis, consisting of a single puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) injection (intraperitoneally 15 mg/100 g body weight), with sacrifice after eight days. TAU limited proteinuria and podocytes foot processes effacement, and balanced slit diaphragm nephrin and glomerular claudin 1 expressions. In cortical proximal tubules, TAU improved lysosomal density, ER perimeter, restored proper ER-mitochondria tethering and mitochondrial cristae, and decreased inflammation.  Remarkably, TAU downregulated glomerular ER stress markers (GRP78, GRP94), pro-apoptotic C/EBP homologous protein, activated caspase 3, tubular caspase1, and mitochondrial chaperone GRP75, but maintained anti-apoptotic HSP25. In conclusion, TAU, by targeting upstream ER stress separate from mitochondria dysfunctions at crucial renal sites, might be a promising dietary supplement in the treatment of the drug-resistant nephrotic syndrome.

Monitoring of small ruminants for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has recently become more relevant after two natural scrapie suspected cases of goats were found to be positive for classical BSE (C-BSE). C-BSE probably established itself in this species unrecognized, undermining disease control measures. This opens the possibility that TSEs in goats may remain an animal source for human prion diseases. Currently, there are no data regarding the natural presence of the atypical BSE in caprines. Here we report that C-BSE and L-type atypical BSE (L-BSE) isolates from bovine species are intracerebrally  transmissible to goats, with a 100% attack rate and a significantly shorter incubation period and survival time after C-BSE than after L-BSE experimental infection, suggesting a lower species barrier for classical agentin goat. All animals showed nearly the same clinical features of disease characterized by skin lesions, including broken hair and alopecia, and abnormal mental status. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed several differences between C-BSE and L-BSE infection, allowing discrimination between the two different strains. The lymphoreticular involvement we observed in the C-BSE positive goats argues in favour of a peripheral distribution of PrPSc similar to classical scrapie. Western blot and other currently approved screening tests detected both strains in the goats and were able to classify negative control animals. These data demonstrate that active surveillance of small ruminants, as applied to fallen stock and/or healthy slaughter populations in European countries, is able to correctly identify and classify classical and L-BSE and ultimately protect public health.

Erratum in     Vet Res Commun. 2018 Aug 6;:.  Salmonella Typhimurium (including S.Typhimurium 1,4,[5],12:i-) and other enteric  pathogens cause acute infection in pigs during the weaning stage, often evolving  into chronic infections responsible for the introduction of zoonotic bacteria into the slaughterhouse and thus determining carcass contamination. In addition to being zoonotic hazards, these pathogens are responsible for economic losses in affected farms. Traditionally, antibiotic treatments have been largely administered in order to reduce the infection burden but it favored, as a direct  consequence, an increase in the number of multi-drug resistance strains. In order to overcome antibiotic-resistance concerns, new alternative control strategies should be developed. In this context, a blend of organic acids, phytochemicals and a permeabilizing complex, administered in feed (Group A - 459 piglets) or water (Group B - 458 piglets), was tested in field conditions for its capability  of reducing Salmonella-infection in weaned piglets of an endemic farm. Data recorded were compared to results of a control group (Group C - 456 piglets). Zootechnical parameters were recorded in all animals, while microbiological, serological and PCR analyses were conducted in 15 piglets for each group. Results demonstrated that additive administered in feed improved animal weight gain (better average daily gain [A.D.G.] and increment), and rapidly reduced Salmonella-shedding in feces. Administration of additive in feed gave better results than in water.  DOI: 10.1007/s11259-018-9723-3 	29790058

Electronic address: massimo.amadori@izsler.it.  Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is an elusive model of host/virus relationship in which disease is determined by virus pathogenicity, pig breed susceptibility and phenotype, microbial infectious pressure and environmental conditions. Successful disease control in PRRS-endemic Countries corresponds to "stability", i.e. a condition with no clinical signs of PRRS in the breeding-herd population and no viremia in weaning-age pigs. The aim of this  work was to compare the profile and time-course of humoral and cell-mediated immunity in stable and unstable herds, respectively. In particular, we investigated PRRS virus (PRRSV) in serum and group oral fluid samples by Real-time RT-PCR, PRRSV-specific IgA and IgG in oral fluids, serum IgG antibody and the cell-mediated response (PRRSV-specific release of interferon-gamma) in whole blood samples. These parameters were measured in order to identify possible discrepancies in the development and kinetics of the immune response against PRRSV. PRRS-free gilts got regularly infected after entering PRRS-stable and unstable farms. In an open cycle, unstable pig farm PRRSV infection could be demonstrated in all groups of pigs, including suckling piglets. Four main results should be highlighted: A) the precocity of the Ab response in group oral fluids was generally similar to that recorded in sera; B) circulation of PRRSV was consistently detected in all age groups in the unstable herds, as opposed to the  stable ones; C) an early, balanced, IgA and IgG response in oral fluids was only  observed in the stable herds; D) an early IFN-gamma response after PRRSV infection was often observed in stable herds, as opposed to the unstable ones. These were characterized by IFN-gamma responses in piglets, likely due to transfer of maternal immunity. Most important, the mucosal IgA response was associated with cessation of virus excretion in oral fluid samples of PRRS-unstable herds. The above findings indicate that a peculiar profile of immune response to PRRSV can be found in PRRS-stable herds. Therefore, the outlined immune parameters can represent a useful readout system to evaluate successful adaptation to PRRSV based on acclimatization of breeding animals and management of pig flow.

In slaughterhouses A and B, four carcass  sites of 100 cm2 each (from both the exterior and interior side) were swabbed with a single sponge. In abattoir C, four 100 cm2 sites of the exterior and the interior sides were swabbed with two independent sponges. The population average  prevalence of Salmonella-positive carcasses (which takes into account the structure of the study design, with multiple samples collected in a single day) in slaughterhouses A and B was 12.3%, while in slaughterhouse C it was 11.2%. Presence of Salmonella on exterior and interior sides of carcasses showed a low level of concordance (only 3/12 of the contaminated carcasses were positive on both sides). No significant difference was found for FCSs contamination in the three slaughterhouses, with a population average prevalence of Salmonella-positive FCSs of 19.9%. In addition, we found that the clustering due  to the day of sampling account for more than 36% and 60% of the overall prevalence variation on carcasses and FCSs, respectively. Eight serovars were identified, with Salmonella Derby as the most common type. The counting of Salmonella on carcasses showed large variability. It was low (<0.0075 most probable number [MPN]/cm2) in 46.6% of the carcasses and as high as 2.7 MPN/cm2 in 4.7%. Specifically, we found that counts on carcasses fit with "heavy tailed"  distributions (lognormal and Weibull with a small shape parameter), suggesting not negligible probability of episodes of high Salmonella contamination. The mean values of contamination obtained with the two distributions ranged from 0.235 to  0.435 MPN/cm2.  DOI: 10.1089/fpd.2017.2375 	29723045

During the past decade, African swine fever (ASF) has spread from the Caucasus region to eastern European Union countries affecting domestic pig and wild boar populations. In order to avert ASF spread, mitigation measures targeting both populations have been established. However, despite these efforts, ASF has been reported in thirteen different countries (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Moldova, Czech Republic, and Romania). In the absence of an effective vaccine or  treatment to ASF, introduction and spread of ASF onto domestic pig farms can only be prevented by strict compliance to control measures. This study systematically  reviewed available measures to prevent the spread of ASF in the EU domestic pig sector distinguishing between commercial, non-commercial, and outdoor farms. The  search was performed in PubMed and using a common browser. A total of 52 documents were selected for the final review process, which included scientific articles, reports, EU documents and official recommendations, among others. From  this literature review, 37 measures were identified as preventive measures for the introduction and spread of ASF. Subsequently, these measures were assessed by ASF experts for their relevance in the mitigation of ASF spread on the three mentioned types of farms. All experts agreed that some of the important preventive measures for all three types of farms were: the identification of animals and farm records; strict enforcement of the ban on swill feeding; and containment of pigs, so as to not allow direct or indirect pig-pig and/or pig-wild boar contacts. Other important preventive measures for all farms were education of farmers, workers, and operators; no contact between farmers and farm staff and external pigs; appropriate removal of carcasses, slaughter residues, and food waste; proper disposal of manure and dead animals, and abstaining from hunting activities during the previous 48 h (allowing a 48 h interval between hunting and being in contact with domestic pigs). Finally, all experts identified that the important preventive measures for non-commercial and outdoor farms is to improve access of those farms to veterinarians and health services.

Livestock and food products of animal origin constitute important reservoirs of intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli including antibiotic-resistant E. coli isolates. To assess potential risks to public health related to E. coli strains of animal origin in Tunisia, 65 E. coli isolates recovered from healthy animals and food products of animal origin were studied. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined according to CLSI guidelines and genes encoding antibiotic resistance as well as virulence factors were investigated by PCR. High rates of antibiotic resistance were observed to kanamycin (78.4%), gentamicin (75.3%) and streptomycin (75.3%, encoded by strA-strB (7 isolates)), amoxicillin (64.6%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (60%),  tetracycline (44.6%; tetA (8 isolates) and tetB (7 isolates)), nalidixic acid (27.6%, qnrS (3 isolates), qnrB (2 isolates) and qnrA (one isolate)) and sulfonamides (36.9%; sul1 (1 isolate), sul2 (4 isolates), and sul3 (1 isolate)).  Virulotypes classified some isolates as STEC (3%), MNEC (1.5%) and atypical EPEC  (1.5%). This study demonstrated high rates of antimicrobial resistance and the presence of some pathogenic pathovars from animal origins that are a cause of concern for public health.

Background and aimEpidemiology of human non-typhoid salmonellosis is characterised by recurrent emergence of new clones of the pathogen over time. Some clonal lines of Salmonella have shaped epidemiology of the disease at global level, as happened for serotype Enteritidis or, more recently, for Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-, a monophasic variant of serotype Typhimurium. The same clonal behaviour is recognisable at sub-serotype level where single outbreaks or more generalised epidemics are attributable to defined clones. The aim of this study was to understand the dynamics of a clone of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- over a 3-year period (2012-15) in a province of Northern Italy where the clone caused a  large outbreak in 2013. Furthermore, the role of candidate outbreak sources was investigated and the accuracy of multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) was evaluated. Methods: we retrospectively investigated the outbreak through whole genome sequencing (WGS) and further monitored the outbreak clone for 2 years after its conclusion. Results: The study showed the transient nature of the clone in the population, possibly as a consequence of its occasional expansion in a food-processing facility. We demonstrated that important weaknesses characterise conventional typing methods applied to clonal pathogens such as Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-, namely lack of accuracy for MLVA and inadequate resolution power for PFGE to be reliably used for clone tracking. Conclusions: The study provided evidence for the remarkable prevention potential  of whole genome sequencing used as a routine tool in systems that integrate human, food and animal surveillance.

AIMS: To evaluate the survival of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) during anaerobic digestion (AD), we studied two different biogas plants loaded with manure and slurry from paratuberculosis-infected dairy herds. METHODS AND RESULTS: Both plants were operating under mesophilic conditions, the  first with a single digester and the second with a double digester. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis detection was performed by sampling each stage of the process, specifically the prefermenter, fermenter, liquid digestate and solid digestate stages, for 11 months. In both plants, MAP was isolated from the prefermenter stage. Only the final products, the solid and liquid digestates, of  the one-stage plant showed viable MAP, while no viable MAP was detected in the digestates of the two-stage plant. CONCLUSIONS: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis showed a significant decrease during subsequent steps of the AD process, particularly in the two-stage plant. We suggest that the second digester maintained the digestate under anaerobic conditions for a longer period of time, thus reducing MAP survival and  MAP load under the culture detection limit. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our data are unable to exclude the presence of MAP in the final products of the biogas plants, particularly those products from the single digester; therefore, the use of digestates as fertilizers is a real concern related to the possible environmental contamination with MAP.  © 2018 The Authors.

This study fully describes a severe disease outbreak occurred in 2016 in black bullhead catfish farmed in Italy. Affected fish showed nervous clinical signs as  well as emaciations and haemorrhagic petechiae on the skin at the fin bases, abdomen and gills. Viral isolation in cell culture allowed the subsequent identification of a rhabdovirus, tentatively named ictalurid rhabdovirus (IcRV),  through electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and whole genome sequencing (WGS). The newly isolated virus, together with 14 additional viral strains stored in our repository and detected during similar mortality episodes in the period 1993-2016, was phylogenetically analysed on the basis of the nucleoprotein and the glycoprotein nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The genetic distances among Italian IcRV strains were also estimated. Our results show that all the IcRV strains belong to the genus Sprivivirus and are closely related to the tench rhabdovirus (TenRV). Italian catfish production is constantly decreasing, mainly  due to viral infections, which include the newly characterized IcRV. Data presented in this work will assist to investigate the molecular epidemiology and  the diffusive dynamics of this virus and to develop adequate surveillance activities.  © 2018 The Authors.

Objectives: KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) represent a serious problem worldwide. Herein, we describe the evolution of ceftazidime/avibactam resistance by sequencing longitudinal clinical isolates from a patient with KPC-Kp bloodstream infection undergoing ceftazidime/avibactam treatment. Methods: WGS was performed on one ceftazidime/avibactam-susceptible KPC-Kp (BOT-CA-S) and two phenotypically different ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp with low (BOT-CA-R) and high (BOT-EMO) carbapenem MICs. The population diversity was assessed by the frequency of allele mutations and population analysis profiles (PAPs). Results: Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clonal relatedness of the KPC-Kp isolates, all belonging to the clone ST1519. The D179Y mutation in blaKPC-3 was detected in both of the ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp, whereas it was absent in the ceftazidime/avibactam-susceptible isolate. The mutation emerged independently in the two ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant isolates and was associated with a significant reduction in carbapenem MICs in BOT-CA-R, but not in BOT-EMO. WGS analysis revealed that the frequency of the D179Y mutation was 96.32% and 51.05% in BOT-CA-R and BOT-EMO, respectively. PAP results demonstrated that carbapenem resistance in BOT-EMO was due to the coexistence of mixed subpopulations harbouring WT and mutated blaKPC-3. A bacterial subpopulation with high ceftazidime/avibactam resistance for BOT-EMO KPC-Kp showed low carbapenem MICs, whereas a subpopulation with high meropenem resistance had a low MIC of ceftazidime/avibactam. Conclusions: Our analysis indicates that mixed subpopulations of ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp emerge after ceftazidime/avibactam treatment. The evolution of different subpopulations that are highly resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam likely contributes to treatment failure, thereby highlighting the need for combination treatment strategies to limit selection of  ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp subpopulations.

Highly pathogenic (HP) PRRSV isolates have been discovered within both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 genotypes and investigated in recent years especially for their ability to cause extremely severe disease in conventional pig herds. The exacerbation of general and respiratory clinical signs has been attributed not only to an efficient replication (virulence) but also to the ability to dysregulate viral recognition and induce mechanisms of immune evasion or immune enhancement of humoral and cellular anti-viral responses differently from non-HP  PRRSV isolates in terms of intensity and temporal onset. Thus, the understanding  of the immunopathogenesis of HP PRRSV is a major concern for the study of virus biology and development of efficacious vaccines. The present study aims at addressing the modulation of relevant immune cell subsets by flow cytometry in the blood of 4-week-old pigs experimentally infected with the recently discovered PR40/2014 HP PRRSV-1.1 strain phenotypically characterized in Canelli et al. (2017) compared to pigs infected with a non-HP PRRSV isolate (PR11/2014) and uninfected controls. PR40 infected animals showed an early and marked reduction of pro-inflammatory CD172α+ CD14+CD16+ and CD14+CD163+ monocytes and TCRγδ+CD8α+/CD8α- lymphocytes when pigs were most infected, possibly due to a recruitment sustaining an acute inflammatory response in target tissues. The prolonged increased CD3+CD16+ NKT cell levels may sustain peripheral inflammation and/or the anti-viral response. The late reduction (potential depletion) of γ/δ T lymphocytes and CD3+CD4+CD8α- naïve Th lymphocytes paralleled with the delayed increase of CD3+CD4+CD8α+ memory and CD3+CD4-CD8α/β + cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In addition, PR40 infection showed an early depletion of activated CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes and Tregs together with an intense and lasting depletion of CD21+ B lymphocytes. Overall, these features demonstrate that the more severe clinical signs observed upon infection with the HP PR40 strain are sustained by remarkable changes in the peripheral blood distribution of immune cells and provide further  insights into the immune regulation/immunopathogenesis induced by PRRSV-1 subtype 1 European isolates.

African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating disease for which there is no vaccine. The ASF virus (ASFV) can infect dendritic cell (DC), but despite the critical role these cells play in induction of adaptive immunity, few studies investigated their response to ASFV infection. We characterized the in vitro interactions of porcine monocyte-derived DCs (moDC) with a virulent (22653/14), a low virulent (NH/P68) and an avirulent (BA71V) ASFV strain. At a high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 1), all three strains infected immature moDC. Maturation of moDC, with IFN-α/TNF-α, increased susceptibility to infection with 22653/14 and other virulent strains, but reduced susceptibility to NH/P68 and BA71V. The reduced moDC susceptibility to BA71V/NH/P68 was IFN-α mediated, whereas increased susceptibility to 22653/14 was induced by TNF-α. Using an MOI of 0.01, we observed that BA71V replicated less efficiently in moDC compared to the other isolates and we detected increased replication of NH/P68 compared to 22653/14. We observed that BA71V and NH/P68, but not 22653/14, downregulated expression of MHC class I on infected cells. All three strains decreased CD16 expression on moDC, whereas ASFV infection resulted in CD80/86 down-regulation and MHC class II DR up-regulation on mature moDC. None of the tested strains induced a strong cytokine response to ASFV and only modest IL-1α was released after BA71V infection. Overall our results revealed differences between strains and suggest that ASFV has evolved mechanisms to replicate covertly in inflammatory DC, which  likely impairs the induction of an effective immune response.

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, strain CV777, was initially characterized in 1978 as the causative agent of a disease first identified in the UK in 1971. This coronavirus has been widely distributed among laboratories and has been passaged  both within pigs and in cell culture. To determine the variability between different stocks of the PEDV strain CV777, sequencing of the full-length genome (ca. 28kb) has been performed in 6 different laboratories, using different protocols. Not surprisingly, each of the different full genome sequences were distinct from each other and from the reference sequence (Accession number AF353511) but they are >99% identical. Unique and shared differences between sequences were identified. The coding region for the surface-exposed spike protein showed the highest proportion of variability including both point mutations and small deletions. The predicted expression of the ORF3 gene product  was more dramatically affected in three different variants of this virus through  either loss of the initiation codon or gain of a premature termination codon. The genome of one isolate had a substantially rearranged 5´-terminal sequence. This rearrangement was validated through the analysis of sub-genomic mRNAs from infected cells. It is clearly important to know the features of the specific sample of CV777 being used for experimental studies.  DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193682  PMCID: PMC5832266	29494671

Wild dabbling ducks are the main reservoir for avian influenza (AI) viruses and pose an ongoing threat to commercial poultry flocks. Combining the (i) size of that population, (ii) their flight distances and (iii) their AI prevalence, the density of AI-infected dabbling ducks (DID) was calculated as a risk factor for the introduction of AI viruses into poultry holdings of Emilia-Romagna region, Northern Italy. Data on 747 poultry holdings and on 39 AI primary outbreaks notified in Emilia-Romagna between 2000 and 2017 were used to validate that risk  factor. A multivariable Bayesian logistic regression was performed to assess whether DID could be associated with the occurrence of AI primary outbreaks. DID  value, being an outdoor flock, hobby poultry trading, species reared, length of cycle and flock size were used as explanatory variables. Being an outdoor poultry flock was significantly associated with a higher risk of AI outbreak occurrence.  The probability of DID to be a risk factor for AI virus introduction was estimated to be 90%. A DID cut-off of 0.23 was identified to define high-risk areas for AI virus introduction. Using this value, the high-risk area covers 43%  of the region. Seventy-four per cent of the primary AI outbreaks have occurred in that area, containing 39% of the regional poultry holdings. Poultry holdings located in areas with a high DID value should be included in a risk-based surveillance programme aimed at AI early detection.  © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

BACKGROUND: Rhabdoviridae is one of the most ecologically diverse families of RNA viruses which can infect a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates. Bats, among mammals, are pointed to harbor a significantly higher proportion of unknown or emerging viruses with zoonotic potential. Herein, we report the isolation of a novel rhabdovirus, detected in the framework of a virological survey on bats implemented in North Italy. METHODS: Virus isolation and identification were performed on samples of 635 bats by using cell cultures, negative staining electron microscopy and PCRs for different viruses. NGS was commonly performed on cell culture supernatants showing cytopathic effect or in case of samples resulted positive by at least one of the PCRs included in the diagnostic protocol. RESULTS: A rhabdovirus was isolated from different organs of a Pipistrellus kuhlii. Virus identification was obtained by electron microscopy and NGS sequencing. The complete genome size was 11,774 nt comprised 5 genes, encoding the canonical rhabdovirus structural proteins, and an additional transcriptional  unit (U1) encoding a hypothetical small protein (157aa) (3'-N-P-M-G-U1-L-5'). The genome organization and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the new virus, named Vaprio virus (VAPV), belongs to the recently established genus Ledantevirus (subgroup B) and it is highly divergent to its closest known relative, Le Dantec  virus (LDV) (human, 1965 Senegal). A specific RT-PCR amplifying a 350 bp fragment of the ORF 6 gene, encoding for L protein, was developed and used to test retrospectively a subset of 76 bats coming from the same area and period, revealing two more VAPV positive bats. CONCLUSIONS: VAPV is a novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus. Genome organization and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that VAPV should be considered a novel species within the genus Ledantevirus for which viral ecology  and disease associations should be investigated.

Electronic address: mareef@arc.agric.za.  The effective control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) requires sensitive, specific and rapid diagnostic tools. However, the control and eradication of FMD  in Africa is complicated by, among other factors, the existence of five of the seven FMD virus (FMDV) serotypes, including the SAT-serotypes 1, 2 and 3 that are genetically and antigenically the most variable FMDV serotypes. A key diagnostic  assay to enable a country to re-gain its FMD-free status and for FMD surveillance, is the 3ABC or the non-structural protein (NSP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although many kits are available to detect 3ABC antibodies, none has been developed specifically for the variable SAT serotypes.  This study designed a SAT-specific NSP ELISA and determined whether this assay could better detect NSP-specific antibodies from FMDV SAT-infected livestock. The assay's performance was compared to validated NSP assays (PrioCheck®-NSP and IZSLER-NSP), using panels of field and experimental sera, vaccinated and/or infected with FMDV SAT1, SAT2 or SAT3. The sensitivity () of the SAT-NSP was estimated as 76% (70%, 81%) whereas the specificity was 96% (95%, 98%) at a 95% confidence interval. The sensitivity and specificity were comparable to the commercial NSP assays, PrioCheck®-NSP (82% and 99%, respectively) and IZSLER-NSP  (78% and 98%, respectively). Good correlations were observed for all three assays.  Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.02.006 	29428400

The implementation of the European Union strategy for polychlorodibenzo-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs) is determining a general reduction of their presence in the environment and in the food chain. The most important route for human exposure to these substances is food consumption and, as a consequence, a progressive decrease of their dietary intake has been observed in the last decades. In this context, it seemed worth updating the PCDD/F and DL-PCB intake estimation for the Italian population. A total of 2659 samples of food of animal and vegetable origin analyzed for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in the period 2013-2016 by accredited official laboratories and the national food consumption database were considered for the dietary intake assessment in different age groups of the Italian general population The median cumulative intake estimates expressed as pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day and computed with a deterministic and a probabilistic approach were 1.40-1.52 for children, 0.82-0.85 for adolescents, and 0.64-0.61 for adults, respectively. Such results confirm the decreasing trend of PCDD/F and DL-PCB dietary intake even though the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) value of 2 WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day is exceeded at the 95th percentile for all age groups, with children as sensitive group. Most contributing food categories to the intake resulted fish, food of vegetable origin, and cheese. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to calculate the target contamination levels able to keep the dietary exposure below the TDI. Computed target levels fall between P50 and P97 of the occurrence distribution of the main food groups, meaning that most of the Italian food production can be considered safe.

We tested cadmium (Cd2+) effects on porcine IPEC-J2 cells, which represent an in  vitro model of the interaction between intestinal cells and both infectious and non-infectious stressors. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of low (2 μM)  to moderate (20 μM) concentrations of Cd2+, in terms of pro-inflammatory gene expression and protein release, as well as of infectivity in a Salmonella typhimurium penetration model. Our data showed a significant (P < .001) increase  of intracellular Cd2+ after 3, 6 and 24 h of exposure with respect to levels at 1 h. These data showed the ability of IPEC-J2 to absorb Cd2+ as a function of both time and concentration. Also, the absorption of this heavy metal was related to a significant modulation of important pro-inflammatory messengers. In particular, down-regulation of IL-8 was associated with a significant decrease of Salmonella typhimurium ability to penetrate into IPEC-J2 cells, in agreement with a previous study in which an anti-IL 8 antibody could significantly inhibit Salmonella penetration into the same cells (Razzuoli et al., 2017). This finding  demonstrates the ability of Cd2+ to affect the outcome of an important host-pathogen relationship. In conclusion, our study highlighted the ability of an environmental pollutant like Cd2+ to modulate innate immune responses in terms of chemokine release and gene expression, and susceptibility to microbial infections.

BACKGROUND: Different phleboviruses are important pathogens for humans; most of these viruses are transmitted by sand flies. An increasing number of new phleboviruses have been reported over the past decade, especially in Mediterranean countries, mainly via their detection in sand flies. RESULTS: At least five different phleboviruses co-circulated in sand flies that were collected in three sites in Emilia-Romagna (Italy) in the summer of 2013. The well-known Toscana virus (TOSV) was isolated; three new, closely related phleboviruses differing in their M segments and tentatively named Ponticelli I, Ponticelli II and Ponticelli III virus, respectively, were isolated; a fifth putative phlebovirus, related to the sand fly fever Naples phlebovirus species, was also detected. The co-circulation, in a restricted area, of three viruses characterized by different M segments, likely resulted from reassortment events.  According to the phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences, the TOSV belongs to clade A, together with other Italian isolates, while the Ponticelli viruses fall within the Salehabad phlebovirus species. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight an unexpected diversity of phleboviruses that co-circulate in the same area, suggesting that interactions likely occur amongst  them, that can present challenges for their correct identification. The co-circulation of different phleboviruses appears to be common, and the bionomics of sand fly populations seem to play a relevant role. Such a complex situation emphasizes the need for detailed investigations of the biology of these viruses to better characterize their pathogenic potential for mammals, including humans.

An expert opinion elicitation, based on a modified Delphi technique, was organized to collect the opinion of 16 Italian veterinarians with the aim of conducting a hazard and a welfare promoter characterization for defining and weighing a list of management and housing factors potentially associated with negative or positive welfare outcomes in dairy cows kept in loose housing systems. In addition, the 16 experts judged a set of animal-based measures in order to rate them by appropriateness and by the level of animal pain and suffering due to the welfare consequences they measure. Veterinary experts were asked to score 52 hazards, 47 welfare promoters and 18 animal-based measures. Management and housing hazards, that were determined to be associated with a very high impact on the welfare of dairy cows, were mainly referred to lactating cows  (absence of bedding material, presence of inadequate or slippery floor in walking areas, wrong design of the lying area), but also the use of harmful tools for animal handling and the lack of scheduled foot inspection, trimming and foot bathing reached very high impact scores. Management and housing welfare promoters dealing with optimal cow comfort around resting obtained the highest ratings, together with the presence of experienced and trained stockpersons, the implementation of an attentive animal grouping strategy and the control of temperature, humidity and ventilation. Considering animal-based measures, the highest ranking of importance was given to observation of lameness, records of mortality of adult cows and calves, observation of integument alterations and body condition scoring. This study has been the starting point for the development of the first Italian national protocol for the assessment of the welfare of dairy cows farmed in loose housing systems.

Electronic address: camilla.luzzago@unimi.it.  The prevalence and genetic diversity of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in a geographic area are largely influenced by live animal trade and management practices. Despite control and eradication programs currently underway in several European countries, the risk of BVDV spread within and among countries is still present. BVDV-1 is the predominant type circulating in European cattle population. In this study, a phylogeographic analysis was applied to the BVDV-1 highest prevalent subtypes in Italy to reconstruct the origin and spatial-temporal distribution and to trace main viral flows between different locations to highlight priority areas for BVDV control. A comprehensive dataset of BVDV-1b (n = 173) and 1e (n = 172) 5' UTR sequences was analysed, including both novel and published sequences from Italy and from European countries bordering and/or with commercial cattle flows with Italy. A common phylogeographic pattern was observed for BVDV-1b and 1e subtypes: interspersion from multiple Italian areas and European countries was widespread until the end of the last century, whereas significant local clusters were observed starting from 2000. These findings support a continuous viral flow among different areas over long time scales with no evidence of significant geographical structure, while local transmission networks are limited to more recent years. Northern Italy has been confirmed as the area of origin of the main clades of both BVDV subtypes at national level, acting both as a crucial area for introduction and a  maintenance source for other areas. Piedmont, Central and Southern Italian regions contributed to limited geographical distribution and local BVDV-1b and 1e persistence. On the whole, priority control measures for BVDV-1b and 1e in Italy  should be focused on: i) implementation of BVDV systematic control in all Northern Italian regions to break the viral flow from larger to smaller animal populations; and ii) breaking the dynamics of infections in regions with self-maintenance of BVDV by voluntary control programs.

BACKGROUND: Direct and indirect contact among animals and holdings are important  in the spread of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of slaughterhouse vehicles in spreading B. hyodysenteriae between unconnected farms. RESULTS: Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and Multiple Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) were used to characterize B. hyodysenteriae strains isolated from trucks. Before cleaning, 976 batches of finishing pigs transported  by 174 trucks from 540 herds were sampled. After cleaning, 763 of the 976 batches were also sampled. Sixty-one of 976 and 4 of 763 environmental swabs collected from trucks before and after cleaning and disinfection operations, respectively,  were positive for B. hyodysenteriae. The 65 isolates in this study originated from 48 farms. Trucks were classified into five categories based on the number of visited farms as follows: category 1: 1-5 farms, category 2: 6-10 farms, category 3: 11-15 farms, category 4: 16-20 farms, category 5: >21 farms. Although the largest number of vehicles examined belonged to category 1, the highest percentage of vehicles positive for B. hyodysenteriae was observed in categories  3, 4 and 5. Specifically, 90.9% of trucks belonging to category 5 were positive for B. hyodysenteriae, followed by categories 4 and 3 with 85.7% and 83.3%, respectively. The results of MLST and MLVA suggest that trucks transporting pigs  from a high number of farms also play a critical role in spreading different B. hyodysenteriae genetic profiles. STVT 83-3, which seems to be the current dominant type in Italy, was identified in 56.25% of genotyped isolates. The genetic diversity of isolated strains from trucks was high, particularly, in truck categories 3, 4 and 5. This result confirmed that MLST and MLVA can support the study of epidemiological links between different B. hyodysenteriae farm strains. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential role of shipments in B. hyodysenteriae spread. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of strict vehicle hygiene practices for biosecurity programmes.

Fungi have a crucial role in the correct maturation of salami, but special attention should be addressed to the production of the nephrotoxic, immunotoxic,  and carcinogenic mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA). In a monitoring study conducted in Northern Italy, OTA was detected by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in 13 out 133 samples of traditional salami (9.8% of the total count). Mycological analysis of these samples yielded 247 fungal isolates which were identified to species level. The most frequent species were Penicillium nalgiovense, P. solitum, and P. chrysogenum. P. nordicum, an OTA-producing species commonly found in proteinaceous food, was not found in these samples. Three isolates were found to be Aspergillus westerdijkiae, an OTA-producing species. In order to check the results of the microbiological identification, 19  different strains of Aspergillus and 94 of Penicillium were tested for the presence of a sequence common to OTA-producing fungi by real-time PCR. None of the studied isolates, including the three A. westerdijkiae, possessed the otanpsPN target which is common to OTA-producing strains. Two out of three isolates of the A. westerdijkiae were also PCR-negative for the otanpsPN gene and did not produce OTA in culture. Conversely, this target sequence was amplified from the DNA purified from 14 salami casings including three casings harboring A. westerdijkiae. The amplification of sequences specific for OTA-producing strains  performed on total genomic DNA extracted directly from salami casings provided a  more suitable approach than PCR analysis of isolates from salami for the OTA-related otanpsPN gene to evaluate the risk of OTA contamination.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate some pathogenic characters of Salmonella enterica strains isolated from poultry. METHODS: Twenty-three genetically distinct Salmonella enterica strains, of different serovars and pulsotype, were examined for virulence traits. Resistance  to gastric acid environment was estimated by measuring the percentage of survived bacterial cells after exposure for 2 h to a synthetic gastric juice. Strains were analyzed with PCR for the presence of the following virulence genes: mgtC and rhuM located on SPI-3, sopB and pipB located on SPI-5, Salmonella virulence plasmid (spv) R (spvR), spvB and spvC located on Salmonella plasmid virulence and sodCI, sopE, and gipA located on prophage. Finally, resistance to 21 antibiotics  was tested with Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: A percentage of 82.60% of strains were resistant to gastric environment  after induction and 60.87% of the strains exhibited constitutive resistance too.  Nineteen different virulence profiles were detected. The phage related genes sodCI and sopE and the plasmid mediated operon spvR, spvB and spvC (spvRBC) were  detected in 82.60%, 47.82% and 52.17% of strains, respectively. Typhimurium and Enteritidis strains showed the highest number of virulence genes. Twenty-one different antibiotic resistance profiles were obtained and two isolates (Typhimurium and Enteritidis) resulted sensible to all the tested molecules. The  ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance profile was detected in seven isolates (30.43%). CONCLUSION: Our results show that paratyphoid Salmonella strains with several characters of pathogenicity, that may be cause of severe pathology in animals and humans, are circulating among poultry.

Mortality caused by rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in wild rabbits is reduced in parts of Australia where the related, non-pathogenic calicivirus RCV-A1 is endemic. Laboratory experiments previously showed that prior infection  with RCV-A1 enabled rabbits to better withstand subsequent infection with highly  virulent RHDV, and this was assumed to explain higher survival. Here, we analyse  serological data from the field suggesting that reduced mortality rates among wild rabbits may also result from rabbits previously infected with RCV-A1 having  a reduced likelihood of RHDV infection. We discuss the possible mechanisms underlying this finding and its implications. The methods we describe for analysing field data gave far greater insights into epidemiological processes and virus interactions than gained from reporting basic seroprevalence rates alone.  © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

In Holstein Friesian dairy cows, selective pressure for increased milk production has led to a higher propensity to disease, including mastitis, when compared to less selected and lower producing dairy breeds. The biology underpinning the higher resistance to disease of such "local breeds" is not fully understood. With the aim of investigating the factors associated to this phenomenon, we applied a  multidisciplinary approach to compare innate immune response patterns, metabolic  parameters, milk protein profiles and the milk microbiota in Holstein Friesian and Rendena cows reared in the same farm and under the same management conditions. Quarter milk samples and blood plasma were collected from all cows at dry-off, 1day after calving, 7-10days after calving and 30days after calving. Quarter milk samples were subjected to bacteriological culture, characterization  of the milk microbiota by 16S metagenomics, milk protein profiling by electrophoresis and densitometry, somatic cell counting, measurement of the inflammation marker cathelicidin and assessment of different innate immune-related mediators such as lysozyme, CD45, IL-1β, TNF-α, PTX3, IL-1R8. In parallel, the main inflammometabolic parameters were measured in blood plasma samples. Despite having relatively few animals (6 moderate-yielding Holstein Friesian and 4 low-yielding Rendena) some important differences were apparent. Holstein Friesian cows showed a more severe fat mobilization and systemic inflammatory response postpartum in comparison with Rendena cows, which had a greater postpartum muscle mass and an increased amino acid mobilization compared  to Holstein Friesians. Upon bacteriological analysis, contagious bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae were absent, but significant differences were seen in the general composition of the milk microbiota of the two breeds. Concerning the milk protein abundance profile, pronounced differences were seen in colostrum, with significantly higher amounts of immunoglobulins and  other immune-related proteins in Rendena. Added to this, the expression of innate immune related genes such as PTX-3, IL-1β, TNF-α, and KRT5 expression in milk epithelial and leukocyte cell components, respectively, was lower in Holstein Friesian colostrum compared with Rendena. In conclusion, several differences were observed in the two breeds, in spite of the same farming conditions. The observations reported in this work present numerous pointers to the factors that  may provide autochthonous, more rustic breeds with a higher resistance to disease.

European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV) was detected in a faecal swab collected from a wolf carcass in Northern Italy. The full-length genome of the EBHSV WOLF/17/2016/ITA strain was determined. In the VP60 capsid gene, the wolf strain displayed the highest genetic identity (99.2-99.1% nucleotide and 99.6-99.7% amino acid) with two EBHSV strains recently found in the intestinal content of a red fox and in the spleen and liver of a hare in Northern Italy. This finding poses interrogatives on the potential role of carnivores as EBHSV passive carriers, favoring the introduction and spread of the virus among different hare populations.

A molecular screening for tick-borne pathogens was carried out in engorged and in questing ticks collected in Verbano Cusio Ossola county, Piemonte region, Italy.  Engorged ticks were removed from wild and domestic animal hosts. The most abundant and common tick species in the area was Ixodes ricinus (192 adults, 907  nymphs). Few individuals of Ixodes hexagonus (15) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (7) were found among the ticks removed from domestic animals (46 examined ticks). The presence of Rickettsia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu latu, Francisella tularensis and Coxiella burnetii was evaluated by PCR and sequencing in 392 individuals of I. ricinus (adult and nymphal stages) and 22 individuals of the two other tick species. Five Borrelia species (i.e. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana and B. lusitaniae), proved or suspected to  cause clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in humans, showed 10.5 and 2.2% combined prevalence in questing and engorged I. ricinus, respectively. In addition, two species of rickettsiae (R. helvetica and R. monacensis) were identified and reported with 14.5 and 24.8% overall prevalence in questing and in engorged ticks. The prevalence of F. tularensis in the ticks collected on two wild ungulate species (Capreolus capreolus and Cervus elaphus) was 5.7%. This work provided further data and broadened our knowledge on bacterial pathogens present in ticks in Northwest Italy.  DOI: 10.1007/s10493-017-0202-2 	29189951

Author information:  (1)First author: UR 1115 Plantes et Systèmes de culture Horticoles, INRA, Avignon, France; second author: UR 1052 Génétique et Amélioration des Fruits et Légumes, INRA, Avignon, France; and third author: Risk Analysis Unit, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Parma, Italy.  Brown rot, caused by Monilinia spp., is a major disease of stone fruit and, in favorable environmental conditions and in the absence of fungicide treatments, it causes important economic losses. In the present work, we propose a modification  of classical susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed compartmental models to grasp the peculiarities of the progression of brown rot epidemics in stone fruit  orchards in the last stage of the fruit growth (i.e., from the end of the pit hardening to harvest time). Namely, we took into account (i) the lifespan of airborne spores; (ii) the dependence of the latent period on the cuticle crack surface area, which itself varies in time with fruit growth; (iii) the impossibility of recovery in infectious fruit; and (iv) the abrupt interruption of disease development by the elimination of the host fruit at harvest time. We parametrized the model by using field data from a peach Prunus persica orchard infected by Monilinia laxa and M. fructicola in Avignon (southern France). The basic reproduction number indicates that the environmental conditions met in the  field were extremely favorable to disease development and the model closely fitted the temporal evolution of the fruit abundance in the different epidemiological compartments. The model permits us to highlight crucial mechanisms undergoing brown rot build up and to evaluate the consequences of different agricultural practices on the quantity and quality of the yield. We found that winter sanitation practices (which decrease the initial infection incidence) and the control of the fruit load (which affects the host fruit density and the single fruit growth trajectory) can be effective in controlling brown rot in conjunction with or in place of fungicide treatments.

The rumen subacute acidosis is the most relevant one, albeit not easily recognized. Recent studies suggest that forestomachs can perform regulatory actions at both regional and systemic levels, since forestomach walls express immune receptors and cytokines, and the rumen liquor is infiltrated by leukocytes. Therefore, the  rumen fluid could be conveniently collected for investigating metabolic production diseases. Thus, we investigated the origin of the leukocytes of the rumen fluid and demonstrated that they partly derive from saliva. Next, we carried out a field survey of innate immunity in rumen fluids of 128 cows from 12 dairy farms, along with clinical inspections, assessment of milk yield, rumen pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and major inflammo-metabolic parameters. Significant statistical correlations were found between immune markers in rumen fluids and biochemical parameters. A significant negative correlation was found in rumen between CD45 gene expression (leukocyte infiltration) and pH level. B cells were  the most frequent mononuclear leukocyte population in the rumen liquor and their  infiltration was negatively affected by low ruminal pH and high concentrations of VFA. Moreover, total Ig and IgM in rumen fluids were negatively correlated with ruminal pH and positively correlated with uremia. Our data suggest that forestomach immune responses could be directed to "dangers" arising within the forestomach environment. The immune markers could integrate consolidated diagnostic parameters (e.g. rumen pH) and contribute to robust, early diagnosis of tricky digestive troubles of cattle.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Since 2013 in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, surveillance information generated in the public health and in the animal health sectors has been shared and used to guide  public health interventions to mitigate the risk of West Nile virus (WNV) transmission via blood transfusion. The objective of the current study was to identify and estimate the costs and benefits associated with this One Health surveillance approach, and to compare it to an approach that does not integrate animal health information in blood donations safety policy (uni-sectoral scenario). Costs of human, animal, and entomological surveillance, sharing of information, and triggered interventions were estimated. Benefits were quantified as the averted costs of potential human cases of WNV neuroinvasive disease associated to infected blood transfusion. In the 2009-2015 period, the One Health approach was estimated to represent a cost saving of €160,921 compared to the uni-sectoral scenario. Blood donation screening was the main cost for both scenarios. The One Health approach further allowed savings of €1.21 million in terms of avoided tests on blood units. Benefits of the One Health approach due to short-term costs of hospitalization and compensation for transfusion-associated disease potentially avoided, were estimated to range from €0 to €2.98 million according to the probability of developing WNV neuroinvasive disease after receiving an infected blood transfusion.

More recently, they have emerged in Europe. These isolates are characterized by high viral loads, severe general clinical signs and high mortality, in sows, weaners and growers. Their genome shows a discontinuous aminoacids deletion in the non-structural protein 2 (NSP2). The present study was aimed at characterizing the clinical, pathological and immunological features of a highly pathogenetic, Italian PRRSV-1 subtype 1 isolate (PRRSV1_PR40/2014), following experimental infection in conventional 4-weeks-old pigs. The PRRSV1_PR40/2014 infected group showed severe clinical signs (high fever and dispnoea). Pathological lesions, including severe lymphocytopenia in bronchial lymph-nodes and thymus were also recorded. Higher serum PRRSV genome copies and lower virus neutralizing antibody titer were observed in the PR40 group, when compared to the group infected with a conventional PRRSV strain. The genetic analysis of the strain, and the phenotypic features observed in the field and reproduced in the experimental study, confirmed the high pathogenicity of the Italian PRRSV-1 subtype 1 PR40 isolate.

Laminitis, a highly debilitating disease of the foot in ungulates, is characterized by pathological changes of the complex lamellar structures that maintain the appendicular skeleton within the hoof. Laminitis is a multifactorial disease that involves perturbation of the vascular, hematological, and inflammatory homeostasis of the foot. Interestingly, the pathogenesis of the disease resembles what is observed in metabolic syndromes and sepsis-induced organ failure in humans and animals. We hypothesized that local administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) might contribute to  establishing an anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic environment, and could stimulate the injured tissue in order to restore its functional integrity. According to this assumption, an experimental protocol based on the local intravenous administration of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (aMSCs) in combination  with PRP was developed for the treatment of horses affected by chronic laminitis. Nine horses with severely compromised venograms (showing grade III and IV laminitis) that had been unsuccessfully treated with conventional therapies were  enrolled. aMSCs and PRP (15 × 10⁶ cells resuspended in 15 mL of PRP) were injected into the lateral or medial digital vein three times, at one-month intervals. The first administration was performed with allogeneic aMSCs, while for the following administrations, autologous aMSCs were used. There was no adverse short-term reaction to the intravenous injection of aMSCs. In the long term, venograms outlined, in all subjects, a progressive amelioration of the vascularization of the foot. An improvement in the structure and function of the  hoof was also observed. No adverse events were reported during the follow-up, and the horses returned to a comfortable quality of life. Although the number of animals enrolled in the study is limited, both clinical observations and venography demonstrated an enhancement in the condition of all horses, suggesting that the regenerative therapies in chronic laminitis could be useful, and are worthy of further investigation.

The inactivation of Salmonella during curing of Italian traditional pork salami was investigated. A total of 150 batches of ground raw meat (GRM) used for salami manufacturing by four producers were tested for Salmonella by real-time PCR followed by ISO 6579 cultural confirmation and MPN enumeration. Salami produced with Salmonella positive GRMs were re-tested at the end of their curing period. Aw, pH and NaCl content were also measured. Detection of Salmonella was performed testing both 25 and 50g of the samples. By Real-Time PCR 37% of the GRMs resulted positive, but cultural detection of Salmonella was obtained in 14% of the samples only. Salmonella enumeration ranged from 31 MPN/g to <1.3 MPN/g. The difference between testing 50g and 25g of the samples was statistically significant (p value≤0.01). In particular, ISO-50g detected Salmonella in 100% of all positive samples, vs. 62% of ISO-25g. Salami made of the contaminated GRMs were 29% Salmonella-positive, as most batches of salami produced with Salmonella-positive  GRMs resulted negative after regular curing (20-48days). Overall, 13% of salami produced with Salmonella-contaminated GRMs were positive. They belonged to six batches, which turned out negative after prolonged curing ranging between 49 and  86days. Salmonella enumeration in salami ranged from 8.7 MPN/g to <1.3 MPN/g. Unlike GRMs, no significant difference was observed between the ISO-50g and the ISO-25g in detecting Salmonella in cured salami (p value: >0.05). The most common Salmonella serovars in GRMs were Derby (52%), Typhimurium monophasic variant 4, (Barbuti et al., 1993), 12:i:- (19%) and Stanley (10%). Salmonella Derby (56%), London, Branderup, Panama (13%, respectively) and Goldcoast (6%) were most frequent in cured salami. The study showed negative correlation between real-time CT values and cultural confirmation of Salmonella, as well as the importance of sample size for Salmonella detection. Among considered factors with possible effect on the occurrence of Salmonella in salami, statistical analysis revealed a role for aw in salami and for Salmonella load in GRMs, while pH and NaCl content  did not significantly affect the probability of finding Salmonella in dry-cured salami in the context of this study. In particular the lower aw values due to longer curing were associated with lower Salmonella presence in traditional dry-cured salami.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electronic address: edoardo.pozio@iss.it.  In Europe, Trichinella spiralis, the most dangerous species for humans of the genus Trichinella, has a patchy distribution with important foci in Eastern countries and Spain. This zoonotic pathogen was apparently not circulating among  wild and domestic animals of Italy. In 2016, muscle larvae belonging to this nematode species were detected in a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) shot in the Piacenza  province (Northern Italy). This parasite may have been introduced into northern Italy from eastern Europe by hunters, by a hunting dog, or by immigrants, who illegally carried infected meat in their personal baggage. In the same year, T. spiralis infected sausages illegally introduced by personal baggage into Italy from Romania, were inadequately disposed of in the garbage of a central Italian town. Even though these two episodes may not be connected in time and space, they represent an increased risk of infection for domestic and wild swine, which are highly susceptible to this pathogen. In these animals, T. spiralis shows a higher larval burden and a longer survival time than other Trichinella species. Since most of the Italian pig production plants are in northern Italy, the circulation  of T. spiralis should be strictly monitored in wildlife living in these areas.  Copyright © 2017.

As reported on RASFF's portal, in the first 9months of 2016, a total of 13 "alerts/information for attention" were issued concerning the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in mould cheeses throughout Europe. This study analyzes the behaviour of L. monocytogenes in Gorgonzola cheese, a typical Italian soft blue-veined cheese, when contaminated at different time points. In the first challenge test, the pasteurized milk was contaminated and the complete cheese manufacture (cheesemaking, ripening) and shelf life was simulated. After a decrease during the first days of the cheesemaking, the pH remained constant for  35days (5weeks) and then it increased rapidly reaching the final values of 6.8±0.02 in the core and 5.8±0.4 on the rind. At the same time, the pathogen concentration decreased (about 2logCFU/g), although during the last week a rapid  pathogen growth was observed after the rise in pH values. When the cheese was stored at thermal abuse condition (8-12°C), the pathogen concentration on the rind was 4.8±0.3 log CFU/g and after 66days (about 9weeks) no significant difference (p>0.05) was observed; whereas, a growth from 5.4±0.4 to 7.1±0.5logCFU/g was observed in the core. A second challenge test was performed using three batches of commercial slices of Gorgonzola cheese inoculated by L. monocytogenes and stored at 8°C. The maximum specific growth rates (μmax, 1/h) of L. monocytogenes estimated ranged from 0.007 to 0.061. The square root model was  used to predict the μmax at others temperature and to establish the time necessary to reach the European critical legal limit of 2logCFU/g, in different storage scenarios. The predictions obtained in this study can be applied to any time-temperature profile, and in particular to the conditions to which the product is most likely to be subject in normal use, up to its final consumption.  This study can be considered a valuable contribution also aimed at supporting the monitoring surveys carried out by officers of the Regional Veterinary Authority.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the Po valley area, Northern Italy, and within the legal framework of the national plan for the surveillance of human vector-borne diseases, WNV surveillance has over time been implemented. The surveillance plans are based on the transdisciplinary and trans-sectorial collaboration between regional institutions involved in public, animal, and environmental health. This integrated surveillance targets mosquitoes, wild birds, humans, and horses and aims at early detecting the viral circulation and reducing the risk of infection in the human populations. The objective of our study was to assess the degree of One Health (OH) implementation (OH-ness) of the WNV surveillance system in three North Italian regions (Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Piedmont) in 2016, following the evaluation protocol developed by the Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH). In detail, we (i) described the OH initiative (drivers, outcomes) and its system (boundaries, aim, dimensions, actors, stakeholders) and (ii) scored different aspects of this initiative (i.e., OH-thinking, -planning, -sharing, -learning, transdisciplinarity and leadership), with values from 0 (=no OH approach) to 1 (=perfect OH approach). We obtained a mean score for each aspect evaluated. We reached high scores for OH thinking (0.90) and OH planning (0.89). Lower scores were attributed to OH sharing (0.83), transdisciplinarity and leadership (0.77), and OH learning (0.67), highlighting some critical issues related to communication and learning gaps. The strengths and weaknesses detected by the described quantitative evaluation will be investigated in detail by a qualitative evaluation (process evaluation), aiming to provide a basis for the development of shared recommendations to refine the initiative and conduct it in a more OH-oriented perspective.

For litter collection and assessment, 55 farms were selected, one shed from each farm was inspected and 9 points were identified within each shed. 3. For each device, used for the evaluation of litter moisture, mean and standard deviation of wetness measures per collection point were assessed. 4. The reliability and overall consistency between the 5 instruments used to measure wetness were high (α = 0.72). 5. Measurement of three out of the  9 collection points were sufficient to provide a reliable assessment of litter moisture throughout the shed. 6. Based on the direct correlation between litter moisture and footpad lesions, litter moisture measurement can be used as a resource based on-farm animal welfare indicator. 7. Among the 5 methods analysed, visual scoring is the most simple and practical, and therefore the best candidate to be used on-farm for animal welfare assessment.

Influenza D virus (IDV), a new member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, was first reported in 2011 in swine in Oklahoma, and consequently found in cattle across North America and Eurasia. To investigate the circulation of IDV among pigs in Italy, in the period between June 2015 and May 2016, biomolecular and virological tests were performed on 845 clinical samples collected from 448 pig farms affected by respiratory distress located in the Po Valley. Serological tests were conducted on 3698 swine sera, including archive sera collected in 2009, as well as samples collected in 2015 from the same region. Viral genome was detected in 21 (2.3%) samples from 9 herds (2%), while virus was successfully isolated from 3 samples. Genetic analysis highlighted that Italian swine IDVs are closely related to the D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 cluster. Sera collected in 2015 showed a high prevalence of IDV antibody titers (11.7%), while archive sera from 2009 showed statistically significant lower positivity rates (0.6%). Our results indicate an  increasing epidemiological relevance of the pathogen and the need for in-depth investigations towards understanding its pathogenesis, epidemiology and possible  zoonotic potential of this emerging virus.

BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis) infection  causes a systemic disease in pigs. Vaccination could represent a solution to reduce prevalence in farms. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of an  attenuated strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium ΔznuABC) against S. Choleraesuis infection. The vaccination protocol combined priming with attenuated S. Typhimurium ΔznuABC vaccine and boost with an inactivated S. Choleraesuis vaccine and we compared the protection conferred to that induced by an inactivated S. Choleraesuis vaccine. METHODS: The first group of piglets was orally vaccinated with S. Typhimurium ΔznuABC and boosted with inactivated S. Choleraesuis, the second one was intramuscularly vaccinated with S. Choleraesuis inactivated vaccine and the third group of piglets was unvaccinated. All groups of animals were challenged with a virulent S. Choleraesuis strain at day 35 post vaccination. RESULTS: The results showed that the vaccination protocol, priming with S. Typhimurium ΔznuABC and boosted with inactivated S. Choleraesuis, applied to group A was able to limit weight loss, fever and organs colonization, arising from infection with virulent S. Choleraesuis, more effectively, than the prime-boost vaccination with homologous S. Choleraesuis inactivated vaccine (group B). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these research findings extend the validity of attenuated S. Typhimurium ΔznuABC strain as a useful mucosal vaccine against S. Typhimurium and S. Choleraesuis pig infection. The development of combined vaccination protocols can have a diffuse administration in field conditions because animals are generally infected with different concomitant serovars.

A closer monitoring of tropane alkaloids (TA) in foods is now recommended by the  European Commission, following a series of alerts related to the contamination of buckwheat with weeds of the genus Datura. A novel, accurate UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the rapid detection of scopolamine and atropine in buckwheat foods. A suitable extraction protocol was set up to maximize recoveries and detection limits in different raw, processed and baked foods. The  method offers good performances in terms of sensitivity, accuracy and precision,  with LOQs at 0.04 and 0.10µg/kg. The established method is suitable for routine determination of trace levels of TA and was applied to 26 different buckwheat-derived organic foods, detecting TA in 3 samples (13.9-83.9µg/kg for atropine and 5.7-10.4µg/kg for scopolamine). Only in one case the level of contamination was relevant in terms of food safety.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.028 	28873551

Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis: (MAP) causes a contagious chronic infection results in Johne's disease in a wide range of animal species, including cattle. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been carried out to identify loci putatively associated with MAP susceptibility by testing each marker separately and identifying SNPs that show a significant association with the phenotype, while SNP with modest effects are usually ignored. The objective of this study was to identify modest-effect genes associated with MAP susceptibility using a pathway-based approach. The Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip  was used to genotype 966 Holstein cows, 483 positive and 483 negative for antibody response to MAP, data were then analyzed using novel SNP-based Gene Set  Enrichment Analysis (GSEA-SNP) and validated with Adaptive Rank Truncated Product methodology. An allele-based test was carried out to estimate the statistical association for each marker with the phenotype, subsequently SNPs were mapped to  the closest genes, considering for each gene the single variant with the highest  value within a window of 50 kb, then pathway-statistics were tested using the GSEA-SNP method. The GO biological process "embryogenesis and morphogenesis" was  most highly associated with antibody response to MAP. Within this pathway, five genes code for proteins which play a role in the immune defense relevant to response to bacterial infection. The immune response genes identified would not have been considered using a standard GWAS, thus demonstrating that the pathway approach can extend the interpretation of genome-wide association analyses and identify additional candidate genes for target traits.

INTRODUCTION: Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a bacterium widely distributed in nature and able to contaminate food processing environments, including those of dairy products. Lm is a primary public health issue, due to the very low infectious dose and the ability to produce severe outcomes, in particular in elderly, newborns, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients. METHODS: In the period between April and July 2015, an increased number of cases  of listeriosis was observed in the area of Pavia, Northern Italy. An epidemiological investigation identified a cheesemaking small organic farm as the possible origin of the outbreak. In this work we present the results of the retrospective epidemiological study that we performed using molecular biology and genomic epidemiology methods. The strains sampled from patients and those from the target farm's cheese were analyzed using PFGE and whole genome sequencing (WGS) based methods. The performed WGS based analyses included: a) in-silico MLST typing; b) SNPs calling and genetic distance evaluation; c) determination of the  resistance and virulence genes profiles; d) SNPs based phylogenetic reconstruction. RESULTS: Three of the patient strains and all the cheese strains resulted to belong to the same phylogenetic cluster, in Sequence Type 29. A further accurate  SNPs analysis revealed that two of the three patient strains and all the cheese strains were highly similar (0.8 SNPs of average distance) and exhibited a higer  distance from the third patient isolate (9.4 SNPs of average distance). DISCUSSION: Despite the global agreement among the results of the PFGE and WGS epidemiological studies, the latter approach agree with epidemiological data in indicating that one the patient strains could have originated from a different source. This result highlights that WGS methods can allow to better.  DOI: 10.1371/currents.outbreaks.633fd8994e9f06f31b3494567c7e504c  PMCID: PMC5510990	28856063

We investigate the time-optimal control problem in SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic models, focusing on different control policies: vaccination, isolation, culling, and reduction of transmission. Applying the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove that,  for all the policies investigated, only bang-bang controls with at most one switch are admitted. When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total infectious burden  over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a  wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a priority due to sanitary restrictions imposed to farms during ongoing epidemics, such as animal movements and export bans.

Pathogens transmitted to humans by phlebotomine sand flies are neglected, as they cause infectious diseases that are not on the priority list of national and international public health systems. However, the infections caused by protozoa of the Leishmania genus and viruses belonging to the Phlebovirus genus (family Phenuiviridae)-the most significant group of viruses transmitted by sand flies-have a relevant role for human pathology. These infections are emerging in  the Mediterranean region and will likely spread in forthcoming decades, posing a  complex threat to human health. Four species and 2 hybrid strains of Leishmania are pathogenic for humans in the Mediterranean Basin, with an estimated annual incidence of 239,500-393,600 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and 1,200-2,000 cases of visceral leishmaniasis. Among the phleboviruses, Toscana virus can cause neuroinvasive infections, while other phleboviruses are responsible for a typical "3-day fever"; the actual incidence of Phlebovirus infections in the Mediterranean area is unknown, although at least 250 million people are exposed.  Here, we reviewed the current literature on epidemiology of sand fly-borne infections in the Mediterranean Basin, with a focus on humans. Our analysis indicates the need for increased public health activities directed to determine the disease burden of these infections as well as to improve their surveillance.  Among the emerging challenges concerning sand fly-borne pathogens, the relationships between sand fly-borne protozoa and viruses should be considered in future studies, including epidemiological links between Leishmania and phleboviruses as well as the conditional capacity for these pathogens to be involved in interactions that may evolve towards increased virulence.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy.  Intestinal infection with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important disease in swine resulting in significant economic losses. Knowledge about the epidemiology, the diagnostic approach and methods of control are of fundamental importance to tackle the disease. The ETEC causing neonatal colibacillosis mostly carry the fimbriae F4 (k88), F5 (k99), F6 (987P) or F41, while the ETEC of post-weaning diarrhoea carry the fimbriae F4 (k88) and F18. These fimbriae adhere to specific receptors on porcine intestinal brush border epithelial cells (enterocytes), starting the process of enteric infection. After this colonization, the bacteria produce one or more enterotoxins inducing diarrhoea, such as the heat stable toxin a (STa), the heat stable toxin b (STb), and the heat labile toxin (LT). A role in the pathogenesis of the disease was demonstrated for these toxins. The diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis is based on the isolation and quantification of the pathogenic E.coli coupled with the demonstration by PCR of the genes encoding for virulence factors (fimbriae and toxins). The diagnostic approach to enteric colibacillosis must consider the differential diagnosis and the potential different causes that can be involved in the outbreak. Among the different methods of control of colibacillosis, the use of antimicrobials is widely practiced and antibiotics are used in two main ways:  as prophylactic or metaphylactic treatment to prevent disease and for therapeutic purposes to treat diseased pigs. An accurate diagnosis of enteric colibacillosis  needs an appropriate sampling for the isolation and quantification of the ETEC responsible for the outbreak by using semi-quantitative bacteriology. Definitive  diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic lesions and results of bacteriology along with confirmation of appropriate virulence factors to identify the isolated E.coli. It is important to confirm the diagnosis and to perform antimicrobial sensitivity tests because antimicrobial sensitivity varies greatly  among E. coli isolates. Growing concern on the increase of antimicrobial resistance force a more rational use of antibiotics and this can be achieved through a correct understanding of the issues related to antibiotic therapy and to the use of antibiotics by both practitioners and farmers.

Influenza A virus (IAV) infection in swine plays an important role in the ecology of influenza viruses. The emergence of new IAVs comes through different mechanisms, with the genetic reassortment of genes between influenza viruses, also originating from different species, being common. We performed a genetic analysis on 179 IAV isolates from humans (n. 75) and pigs (n. 104) collected in Northern Italy between 2010 and 2015, to monitor the genetic exchange between human and swine IAVs. No cases of human infection with swine strains were noticed, but direct infections of swine with H1N1pdm09 strains were detected. Moreover, we pointed out a continuous circulation of H1N1pdm09 strains in swine populations evidenced by the introduction of internal genes of this subtype. These events contribute to generating new viral variants-possibly endowed with pandemic potential-and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance at both animal and human level.  © 2017 The Authors.

PURPOSE: Highly discriminatory genotyping strategies are essential in molecular epidemiological studies of tuberculosis. In this study we evaluated, for the first time, the efficacy of the repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) DiversiLab Mycobacterium typing kit over spoligotyping, 12-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing and embB single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis for Mycobacterium bovis typing. METHODOLOGY: A total of 49 M. bovis animal isolates were used. DNA was extracted  and genomic DNA was amplified using the DiversiLab Mycobacterium typing kit. The  amplified fragments were separated and detected using a microfluidics chip with Agilent 2100. The resulting rep-PCR-based DNA fingerprints were uploaded to and analysed using web-based DiversiLab software through Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Rep-PCR DiversiLab grouped M. bovis isolates into ten different clusters. Most isolates sharing identical spoligotype, MIRU-VNTR profile or embB  gene polymorphism were grouped into different rep-PCR clusters. Rep-PCR DiversiLab displayed greater discriminatory power than spoligotyping and embB SNP analysis but a lower resolution power than the 12-locus MIRU-VNTR analysis. MIRU-VNTR confirmed that it is superior to the other PCR-based methods tested here. CONCLUSION: In combination with spoligotyping and 12-locus MIRU-VNTR analysis, rep-PCR improved the discriminatory power for M. bovis typing.  DOI: 10.1099/jmm.0.000536 	28771142

Gut is often a receptacle for many different pathogens in feed and/or the environment, such as Salmonella spp. The current knowledge about pathogenicity of Salmonella is restricted to few serotypes, whereas other important ones like S. Coeln, S. Thompson, S. Veneziana, have not been investigated yet in human and animal models. Therefore, the aim of our work was to verify the ability of widespread environmental Salmonella strains to penetrate and modulate innate immunity in pig intestinal IPEC-J2 cells. Our results outline the different ability of Salmonella strains to modulate innate immunity; the expression of the  IFN-β gene was increased by S. Typhimurium, S. Ablogame and S. Diarizonae 2, that also caused an inflammatory response in terms of Interleukin (IL)-1β and/or IL-8  gene espression. In particular, IL-8 gene expression and protein release were significantly modulated by 5 Salmonella strains out of 7. Interestingly, S. Typhimurium, S. Coeln and S. Thompson strains, characterized by a peculiar ability to penetrate into IPEC-J2 cells, up-regulated both IL-8 and TNF-α gene expression. Accordingly, blocking IL-8 was shown to decrease the penetration of S. Typhimurium. On the contrary, S. Diarizonae strain 1, showing lesser invasion  of IPEC-J2 cells, down-regulated the p38-MAPK pathway, and it did not induce an inflammatory response. Our results confirm that IPEC-J2 cells are a useful model  to evaluate host-gut pathogen interaction and indicate IL-8 and TNF-α as possible predictive markers of invasiveness of Salmonella strains in enterocytes.

West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV), genus Flavivirus, are members of the Japanese encephalitis virus antigenic complex, and are maintained primarily in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds. WNV is zoonotic, and poses a threat to public health, especially in relation to blood transfusion. Serosurveillance of wild birds is suitable for early detection of WNV circulation, although concerns remain to be addressed as regards i) the type of test used, whether ELISA, virus neutralization test (VNT), plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), ii) the reagents (antigens, revealing antibodies), iii) the different bird species involved, and iv) potential cross-reactions with  other Flaviviruses, such as USUV. The authors developed an indirect IgG ELISA with pan-avian specificity using EDIII protein as antigen and a monoclonal antibody (mAb 1A3) with broad reactivity for avian IgG. A total of 140 serum samples were collected from juvenile European magpies (Pica pica) in areas where  both WNV and USUV were co-circulating. The samples were then tested using this in-house ELISA and VNT in parallel. Estimation of test accuracy was performed using different Bayesian two latent class models. At a cut-off set at an optical  density percentage (OD%) of 15, the ELISA showed a posterior median of diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 88% (95%PCI: 73-99%) and a diagnostic specificity (DSp) of 86% (95%PCI: 68-99%). At this cut-off, ELISA and VNT (cut-off 1/10) performances  were comparable: DSe=91% (95%PCI: 79-99%), and DSp=77% (95%PCI: 59-98%). With the cut-off increased to 30 OD%, the ELISA DSe dropped to 78% (95%PCI: 52-99%), and the DSp rose to 94% (95%PCI: 83-100%). In field conditions, the cut-off that yields the best accuracy for the ELISA appears to correspond to 15 OD%. In areas  where other Flaviviruses are circulating, however, it might be appropriate to raise the cut-off to 30 OD% in order to achieve higher specificity and reduce the detection of seropositive birds infected by other Flaviviruses, such as USUV.

Lagoviruses belong to the Caliciviridae family. They were first recognized as highly pathogenic viruses of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) that emerged in the 1970-1980s, namely, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV), according to the host species from which they had been first detected. However, the diversity of lagoviruses has recently expanded to include new related viruses with varying pathogenicity, geographic distribution and host ranges. Together with the frequent recombination observed amongst circulating viruses, there is a clear need to establish precise guidelines for classifying and naming lagovirus strains. Therefore, here we propose a new nomenclature based on phylogenetic relationships. In this new nomenclature, a single species of lagovirus would be recognized and called Lagovirus europaeus. The species would be divided into two genogroups that correspond to RHDV- and EBHSV-related viruses, respectively. Genogroups could be subdivided into genotypes, which could themselves be subdivided into phylogenetically well-supported variants. Based on  available sequences, pairwise distance cutoffs have been defined, but with the accumulation of new sequences these cutoffs may need to be revised. We propose that an international working group could coordinate the nomenclature of lagoviruses and any proposals for revision.  DOI: 10.1099/jgv.0.000840 	28714849

The objective of this study was to assess the in vitro effect of iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) and amphotericin B (AMB) on Prototheca zopfii genotype 2 and Prototheca blaschkeae isolates recovered from dairy herds of Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Poland. The combination of IPBC with AMB on Prototheca isolates and toxicity of IPBC to the bovine mammary epithelial cells were also evaluated. The in vitro activity of IPBC and AMB against 96 isolates of P. zopfii genotype 2 and 42 isolates of P. blaschkeae was performed. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum algicidal concentrations (MAC) of IPBC and AMB were determined. To determine any synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effect of the combination of IPBC and AMB, 2-dimensional checkerboard combination tests  were also performed to calculate fractional inhibitory concentrations. Cytotoxicity analysis of IPBC to the bovine mammary epithelial cell line was performed using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The MIC for 50 and 90% of isolates (MIC50 and MIC90, respectively) for IPBC were 4 and 8 mg/L versus 0.5 and 1 mg/L for AMB, respectively. The MIC profiles differed between P. zopfii genotype 2 and P. blaschkeae, with the latter species being more susceptible to both compounds. The MIC50 and MIC90 of IPBC were 4 and 8 mg/L for P. zopfii genotype 2 and 1 and 2 mg/L for P. blaschkeae, respectively. The MIC50 and MIC90 of AMB were both 1 mg/L for P. zopfii genotype  2 and 0.25 and 1 mg/L for P. blaschkeae, respectively. Both IPBC and AMB exhibited the ability to kill Prototheca spp. The MAC for 90% of isolates of IPBC was twice the MIC90, whereas an 8-fold increase of the MIC90 was algicidal in the case of AMB. Overall, the combined use of IPBC and AMB exhibited an increased algicidal effect, albeit the fractional inhibitory concentration index showed synergistic activity only against 3 P. zopfii genotype 2 isolates. For all the remaining isolates (87.5%), this combination produced only an additive effect. The MTT assay results showed both IPBC and AMB, at the concentrations employed in the study, to be nontoxic to the epithelial mammary gland cells (cell viability >90%). Notably, only IPBC at the highest concentration (i.e., 8 mg/L) exerted a slight cytotoxic effect on the cell line tested (mean cell viability: 88.54 ± 3.88 and 90.66 ± 3.0, after 2 and 4 h of MTT treatment, respectively). The anti-Prototheca activity of IPBC was here demonstrated for the first time. In addition, the combined use of IPBC with AMB enhanced each other's effect, creating an additive rather than synergistic interaction. Both agents, used at concentrations corresponding to MIC values against Prototheca spp., showed no toxic effect for the mammary epithelial cells. In conclusion, IPBC, used either alone or in combination with AMB, can be considered a promising option in the treatment armamentarium for protothecal mastitis in dairy cows.

We conducted a cross-sectional study during 2013 to quantify the serological prevalence of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) infection and to investigate host  factors associated with PPR infection in small ruminants in Libya. A two-stage sampling design was carried out. A total number of 148 flocks owning at least 100 heads each were randomly selected. Sixteen to forty-eight samples were collected  from each selected flock. A total number of 3,508 serum samples from unvaccinated animals were collected and analysed at IZSLER Brescia, Italy, by using competitive ELISA, IDvet innovative diagnostics (IDvet 310, France). The overall  serological prevalence among SR was 33% (95% CI: 31.4-34.5). Significant differences between the prevalence in the geographical branches were observed. The lowest prevalence level was observed in Zawiyah branch (16.1%), whereas the highest value was obtained for the Sabha branch (56.8%). Considering the age, a serological prevalence of 24.7%, 31.5% and 42.1% was observed in SR <1 year, between 1 and 2 years and more than 2 years, respectively. Statistically significant differences (p < .001) in the sero-prevalence levels were also observed between the age groups. Our findings suggest that the southern part of Libya could be more exposed to the infections coming from the neighbouring countries and this should be better investigated to correctly identify wherever specific entry points can be considered at higher risk than others. The results also confirmed the endemic status of PPR in Libya, with a constant exposure to the infection of the animals during their life. In the framework of the global strategy for control and eradication of PPR, our results, even if obtained by a preliminary study, can contribute to the assessment of the epidemiological situation of PPR in Libya as required by the Stage 1 of the plan.  © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

The demand for rapid methods for the quantification of pathogens is increasing. Among these methods, those based on nucleic acids amplification (quantitative PCRs) are the most widespread worldwide. Together with the qPCR, a new approach named digital PCR (dPCR), has rapidly gained importance. The aim of our study was to compare the results obtained using two different dPCR systems and one qPCR in  the quantification of three different bacterial pathogens: Listeria monocytogenes, Francisella tularensis, and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. For this purpose, three pre-existing qPCRs were used, while the same primers and probes, as well as PCR conditions, were transferred to two different dPCR systems: the QX200 (Bio-Rad) and the Quant Studio 3D (Applied Biosystems). The limits of detection and limits of quantification for all pathogens, and all PCR approaches applied, were determined using genomic pure DNAs. The quantification of unknown decimal suspensions of the three bacteria obtained by the three different PCR approaches was compared through the Linear Regression and Bland and Altman analyses. Our results suggest that, both dPCRs are able to quantify the same amount of bacteria, while the comparison among dPCRs and qPCRs, showed both over and under-estimation of the bacteria present in the unknown suspensions. Our results showed qPCR over-estimated the amount of M.  avium subsp. paratuberculosis and F. tularensis cells. On the contrary, qPCR, compared to QX200 dPCR, under-estimated the amount of L. monocytogenes cells. However, the maximum difference among PCRs approaches was <0.5 Log10, while cultural methods underestimated the number of bacteria by one to two Log10 for Francisella tularensis and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. On the other hand, cultural and PCRs methods quantified the same amount of bacteria for  L. monocytogenes, suggesting for this last pathogen, PCRs approaches can be considered as a valid alternative to the cultural ones.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes in Escherichia coli from pigs affected by post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD). METHODS: DNA samples collected from 51 E. coli isolates from Italian pigs affected by PWD in 2015-2016 were studied. Isolates were classified as presumptively resistant to colistin by routine susceptibility testing and were investigated for the presence of the mcr-1 gene of plasmid origin by PCR. E. coli isolates testing negative for mcr-1 were analysed for the presence of a novel plasmid-mediated gene, mcr-2. Isolates were characterised for fimbrial [F4 (k88), F5 (k99), F6 (987P), F18 and F41] and toxin (LT, STa, STb and Stx2e) determinants by PCR as well as for the occurrence of haemolysis by phenotypic observation. Susceptibility to apramycin, cefquinome, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) was also determined by disk  diffusion. RESULTS: Most of the isolates showed the presence of at least one virulence factor, confirming their pathogenic potential. The presence of mcr-1 was shown in 37 (72.5%) of the 51 isolates. All of the mcr-1-negative isolates tested negative for the mcr-2 gene. Moreover, 80.4% of the isolates were resistant to apramycin,  9.8% to cefquinome, 54.9% to enrofloxacin, 52.9% to florfenicol, 76.5% to gentamicin, 96.1% to tetracycline and 78.4% to SXT. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report documenting the presence of the mcr-1 gene  in pathogenic E. coli isolated from pigs affected by PWD in Italy.

An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of crude protein (CP) concentration and dietary electrolyte balance (DEB) on growth performance, processing yields, litter quality and foot pad dermatitis (FPD) in male turkeys from two commercial hybrids. Soya bean meal was replaced by vegetable protein sources selected for lower K concentrations to lower DEB in order to improve litter quality and subsequent quality of foot pads. 2. Effects of CP on litter friability and wetness were not consistent during the production period. FPD in turkeys fed on diets with low CP was significantly lower than FPD in turkeys fed  on diets with high CP until 84 d. Growth performance was adversely affected at low CP. Processing yields were not affected by CP. 3. Litter was significantly dryer in pens of turkeys fed on diets with low DEB than in pens of turkeys fed on diets with high DEB. FPD in turkeys fed on diets with low DEB was significantly lower than in turkeys fed on diets with high DEB. Growth performance and processing yields were adversely affected at low DEB. 4. FPD in turkey hybrid A was higher than in turkey hybrid B at 28 d of age. Thereafter, no differences in  FPD between turkey hybrids were observed. Growth performance and processing yields were not affected by turkey hybrid. 5. Overall, a significant interaction  effect of CP × DEB was observed for FCR: in turkeys fed on the high DEB treatment, FCR of turkeys fed on the high CP diets was lower than FCR of turkeys  fed on the low CP (LCP) diets whereas on the low DEB treatment, FCR was not affected by CP treatment. 6. It was concluded that litter quality can be improved and FPD may be decreased in turkeys fed on diets containing lower CP and DEB levels.  DOI: 10.1080/00071668.2017.1349296 	28675310

Fibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and an extensive array of other symptoms including disordered sleep, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Important factors involved in the pathogenic process of fibromyalgia are inflammation and oxidative stress, suggesting that ant-inflammatory and/or antioxidant supplementation might be effective in the management and modulation of this syndrome. Recent evidence suggests that melatonin may be suitable for this purpose due to its well known ant-inflammatory, antioxidant and analgesic effects. Thus, in the current study,  the effects of the oral supplementation of melatonin against fibromyalgia-related skeletal muscle alterations were evaluated. In detail, 90 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly treated with reserpine, to reproduce the pathogenic process of fibromyalgia and thereafter they received melatonin. The animals treated with reserpine showed moderate alterations at hind limb skeletal muscles level and had difficulty in moving, together with significant morphological and ultrastructural alterations and expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in the gastrocnemius muscle. Interestingly, melatonin, dose and/or time dependently, reduced the difficulties in spontaneous motor activity and the musculoskeletal morphostructural, inflammatory, and oxidative stress alterations. This study suggests that melatonin in vivo may be an effective tool in the management of fibromyalgia-related musculoskeletal morphofunctional damage.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major agent of dairy cow intramammary infections: the different prevalences of mastitis reported might be related to a  combination of S. aureus virulence factors beyond host factors. The present study considered 169 isolates from different Italian dairy herds that were classified into four groups based on the prevalence of S. aureus infection at the first testing: low prevalence (LP), medium-low (MLP), medium-high (MHP) and high (HP).  We aimed to correlate the presence of virulence genes with the prevalence of intramammary infections in order to develop new strategies for the control of S.  aureus mastitis. Microarray data were statistically evaluated using binary logistic regression and correspondence analysis to screen the risk factors and the relationship between prevalence group and gene. The analysis showed: (1) 24 genes at significant risk of being detected in all the herds with infection prevalence >5%, including genes belonging to microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs), immune evasion and serine proteases; and (2) a significant correlation coefficient between the genes interacting with the host immune response and HP isolates against LP ones. These  results support the hypothesis that virulence factors, in addition to cow management, could be related to strain contagiousness, offering new insights into vaccine development.

Bovine tuberculosis, a reemerging zoonosis in diverse ecological scenarios, has been reported in the autochthonous Nebrodi black pig breed population used for meat production in Italy. During a routine abattoir inspection in 2013, 24 of 299 carcasses (8%) of Nebrodi black pigs presented tuberculosis-like lesions at pathologic examination. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from 23 animals and M. caprae from a 3-year-old sow. The sow showed severe diffuse lesions involving the visceral organs, right coxofemoral joint, and mammary glands. Isolation of M. caprae from mammary glands is uncommon, with only one other case involving a sow  reported so far; however, Mycobacteria infection of the mammary glands may be transmitted from lactating sows to piglets, contributing to the spread and maintenance of bovine tuberculosis in swine. Genotyping analysis showed M. caprae spoligotype SB0866 and profile 4,1,5,4,4,11,4,2,4,3,8,7 MIRU-VNTR (mycobacterial  interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats). The worldwide prevalence of this spoligotype is very low. The finding of severe, diffuse tuberculous lesions strongly suggests that Nebrodi black pigs are susceptible for Mycobacterium spp. and that they might act as a distributor for these microorganisms. Since natural ecosystems with multiple contacts among different livestock species and wild animals are very common in Mediterranean regions, current surveillance and eradication plans for bovine tuberculosis will need to be extended to other potential reservoir species in regions where extensive and traditional breeding systems are operated.

The incidence of pesticides in poisoned baits recovered from 2005 to 2014 in Italian northern regions of Emilia Romagna and Lombardy was analysed. A total of  956 baits tested positive for pesticides during the study period. In 9.3% (n=89)  of the baits analysed more than one toxic compound was present. Insecticides (53.2%) proved to be the pesticides most commonly involved followed by rodenticides (34.3%), molluscicides (12.3%) and herbicides (0.2%). Among insecticides, the anticholinesterases (organophosphates and carbamates) were the  most frequently detected (59.1%, n=412) followed by organochlorines (39.8%; n=277). Anticoagulants proved to be the rodenticides most commonly involved (78.5%; n=353) with many baits containing brodifacoum or bromadiolone, while metaldehyde was the most used molluscicide (88.2%; n=142). A high number of baits contained banned pesticides such as endosulfan, methamidophos, carbofuran and strychnine indicating that the restrictions and the bans on the use of toxic and  highly toxic pesticides are not accompanied by a lower use in poisoned baits. The high incidence of banned pesticides detected in the present survey is extremely worrying and poses the question of where and how these compounds were obtained. Efforts have to be made to reduce this illegal practice and its environmental impact. Moreover, education and awareness campaigns should be instituted.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Infectious diseases in livestock can be transmitted through fomites: objects able to convey infectious agents. Between-farm spread of infections through fomites is mostly due to indirect contacts generated by on-farm visits of personnel that can carry pathogens on their clothes, equipment, or vehicles. However, data on farm visitors are often difficult to obtain because of the heterogeneity of their nature and privacy issues. Thus, models simulating disease spread between farms usually rely on strong assumptions about the contribution of indirect contacts on infection spread. By using data on veterinarian on-farm visits in a dairy farm system, we built a simple simulation model to assess the role of indirect contacts on epidemic dynamics compared to cattle movements (i.e. direct contacts). We showed that including in the simulation model only specific subsets of the information available on indirect contacts could lead to outputs widely different from those obtained with the full-information model. Then, we provided  a simple preferential attachment algorithm based on the probability to observe consecutive on-farm visits from the same operator that allows overcoming the information gaps. Our results suggest the importance of detailed data and a deeper understanding of visit dynamics for the prevention and control of livestock diseases.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia ed Emilia Romagna "Bruno Ubertini", Brescia, Italy.  AIMS: To evaluate and compare the capabilities of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) techniques to characterize Brachyspira hyodysenteriae isolates and to investigate the relationship between pleuromutilin resistance and genetic variability. METHODS AND RESULTS: MLST genotyping was performed on 180 B. hyodysenteriae isolates, and the results were evaluated considering profiles from 108 other strains previously reported in the database. In total, 37 sequence types were obtained. The MLVA approach completely characterized 172 strains and grouped the  isolates into 22 different profiles. The combination of MLST and MLVA showed a slight increase in the discriminatory power, identifying 33 joint profiles. An antibiotic resistance analysis showed a reduction in the susceptibility to pleuromutilins over time, and a weak association between susceptibility to valnemulin and inclusion in clonal complex 4. CONCLUSION: MLST and MLVA are reliable methods for characterizing B. hyodysenteriae strains and they have comparable discriminatory power. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The genotyping of B. hyodysenteriae isolates and a database of all the genetic profiles collected during the diagnostic activities could support traditional epidemiological investigations in identifying infection sources and routes of transmission among herds, and in developing more effective control measures.  © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

BACKGROUND: Molecular subtyping and enhanced surveillance in Lombardy region identified a cluster of possibly related listeriosis cases from 2006 to 2010. This cluster grouped 31 isolates that belonged to serotype 1/2a and Sequence Type 38 (ST38) as defined by Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST). METHODS: Our study expanded the previous investigation to include cases from 2011 to 2014 and used Multi-Virulence-Locus Sequence Typing (MVLST) on all ST38 isolates to better understand their epidemiology and possibly identify a common source outbreak. RESULTS: Out of 306 L. monocytogenes clinical isolates collected, 43 (14.1%) belonged to ST38 with cases occurring in nine out of twelve Lombardy provinces. The ST38 isolates were split by MVLST into two Virulence Types (VTs): VT80 (n = 12) and VT104 (n = 31). VT104 cases were concentrated between 2009 and 2011  in two provinces, Bergamo and Milan. An epidemiologic investigation was performed and in one case, a matching VT104 isolate was retrieved from a soft cheese sample from a patient's refrigerator. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed a major listeriosis outbreak in Northern Italy linked to soft cheese in 2009-2011, which went undetected by local health authorities. Our study shows that integrating subtyping methods with conventional epidemiology can help identify the source of L. monocytogenes outbreak clones.

This study evaluated the vector competence of Aedes albopictus in transmitting USUV after oral infection under laboratory conditions. Ae. albopictus showed a low vector competence for USUV, although the positive body sample found with a very high number of viral copies at one week post infection indicates that a replication in the mosquito body can occur, and that USUV can escape the midgut barrier. Field data from an extensive entomological arboviruses surveillance program showed a relevant incidence of Ae. albopictus USUV positive pools in the  period 2009-2012 while all pools were negative from 2013 on. No conceivable explanation regarding this field evidence was addressed, suggesting that attention must be paid to the trend of development of this vector-pathogen association, being aware of the potential rapid arbovirus' adaptation to new vectors, to prevent possible new disease's emergence.

The current circulating swine influenza virus (IV) subtypes in Europe (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) are associated with clinical outbreaks of disease. However, we showed that pigs could be susceptible to other IV strains that are able to cross  the species barrier. In this work, we extended our investigations into whether different IV strains able to cross the species barrier might give rise to different innate immune responses that could be associated with pathological lesions. For this purpose, we used the same samples collected in a previous study of ours, in which healthy pigs had been infected with a H3N2 Swine IV and four different H3N8 IV strains circulating in different animal species. Pigs had been  clinically inspected and four subjects/group were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 21 days post infection. In the present study, all groups but mock exhibited antibody responses to IV nucleoprotein protein. Pulmonary lesions and high-titered viral replication were observed in pigs infected with the swine-adapted virus. Interestingly, pigs infected with avian and seal H3N8 strains also showed moderate lesions and viral replication, whereas equine and canine IVs did not cause overt pathological signs, and replication was barely detectable. Swine IV infection induced interferon (IFN)-alpha and interleukin-6 responses in bronchoalveolar fluids (BALF) at day 3 post infection, as opposed to the other non-swine-adapted virus strains. However, IFN-alpha responses to the swine-adapted virus were not associated with an increase of the local, constitutive expression of IFN-alpha genes. Remarkably, the Equine strain gave rise to a Serum Amyloid A response in BALF despite little if any replication. Each virus strain could be associated with expression of cytokine genes and/or proteins after infection. These responses were observed well beyond the period of virus replication, suggesting a prolonged homeostatic imbalance of the innate immune system.

Incursion of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) into Sweden was documented  in 1990 and it is now considered endemic in wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2), a new, related lagovirus was first detected in France in 2010, and has spread rapidly throughout Europe and beyond. However, knowledge of RHDV2 in northern Europe is sporadic and incomplete, and in Sweden, routinely available diagnostic methods to detect rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) do not distinguish between types of virus causing disease. Using RHDV2-specific RT-qPCR, sequencing of the VP60 gene and immunological virus typing of archived and prospective case material from the National Veterinary Institute's (SVA) wildlife disease surveillance programme and diagnostic pathology service, we describe the emergence of RHDV2 in Sweden in both wild and domestic rabbits. The earliest documented outbreak occurred on 22 May 2013, and from May 2013 to May 2016, 10 separate incidents of RHDV2 were documented from six different municipalities in the southern half of Sweden. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP60 gene shows clear clustering of Swedish isolates into three separate clusters within two different clades according to geographic  location and time, suggesting viral evolution, multiple introduction events or both. Almost all cases of RHD examined by SVA from May 2013 to May 2016 were caused by RHDV2, suggesting that RHDV2 may be replacing RHDV as the predominant cause of RHD in Sweden.  © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), due to Escherichia coli, is an important cause of economic losses to the pig industry primarily as a result of mortality and worsened productive performance. In spite of its relevance, recent  data about the prevalence of virulence genes and pathotypes among E. coli isolates recovered from cases of PWD in Europe are scarce. RESULTS: This study investigates the prevalence of fimbrial and toxin genes of E. coli by PCR among 280 farms with PWD across Europe. A total of 873 samples collected within the first 48 h after the onset of PWD (occurring 7-21 days post  weaning) were submitted to the laboratory for diagnostic purposes. Isolation and  identification of E. coli were performed following standard bacteriological methods and PCR assays for the detection of genes encoding for fimbriae (F4, F5,  F6, F18 and F41) and toxins (LT, STa, STb and Stx2e). The prevalence of fimbriae  and toxins among E. coli isolates from cases of PWD was: F4 (45.1 %), F18 (33.9 %), F5 (0.6 %), F6 (0.6 %), F41 (0.3 %), STb (59.1 %), STa (38.1 %), LT (31.9 %) and Stx2e (9.7 %). E. coli isolates carrying both fimbrial and toxin genes were detected in 52.5 % of the cases (178 out of 339 isolates), with 94.9 % of them being classified as enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). The most common virotype detected was F4, STb, LT. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that ETEC is frequently isolated in pig farms with PWD across Europe, with F4- and F18-ETEC variants involved in 36.1 % and 18.2 % of the outbreaks, respectively.

Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in North Africa (2013) and the Gulf States (2013) of the Middle East have been caused by a FMD viral lineage (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001) that was before 2013 restricted to the Indian Sub-continent. This study was undertaken to assess the in vivo efficacy of a FMD virus emergency vaccine type O1 Manisa against heterologous challenge with a representative field virus (O/ALG/3/2014) from this emerging lineage. This widely available vaccine was selected since in vitro vaccine-matching results gave inconclusive results as to whether or not it would be protective. Three groups of five cattle were vaccinated with O1 Manisa (homologous potency ≥6PD50/dose) using study guidelines outlined in the European Pharmacopeia, and challenged at 21days post-vaccination  by tongue inoculation. All animals that were vaccinated with the lowest dose (1/16) of vaccine developed generalised FMD, defined as vesicular lesions at the  feet. One animal vaccinated with a 1/4 dose of the vaccine also developed generalised disease, as did two animals vaccinated with the full dose of vaccine. These results indicate that the heterologous potency of this high potency O1 Manisa vaccine was approximately 3.5 PD50/dose. These data support the use of the O1 Manisa vaccine for FMD control in areas where FMDV is endemic e.g. North Africa, and motivate further studies to evaluate other vaccine candidates (or multivalent combinations) that might be potentially used for emergency purposes in FMD-free settings.

Vero cell lines are extensively employed in viral vaccine manufacturing. Similarly to all established cells, mutations can occur during Vero cells in vitro amplification which can result in adverse features compromising their biological safety. To evaluate the potential neoplastic evolution of these cells, in vitro transformation test, gene expression analysis and karyotyping were compared among low- (127 and 139 passages) and high-passage (passage 194) cell lines, as well as transformed colonies (TCs). In vivo tumorigenicity was also tested to confirm preliminary in vitro data obtained for low passage lines and TCs. Moreover, Vero cells cultivated in foetal bovine serum-free medium and derived from TCs were analysed to investigate the influence of cultivation methods on tumorigenic evolution. Low-passage Vero developed TCs in soft agar, without showing any tumorigenic evolution when inoculated in the animal model. Karyotyping showed a hypo-diploid modal chromosome number and rearrangements with no difference among Vero cell line passages and TCs. These abnormalities were reported also in serum-free cultivated Vero. Gene expression revealed that high-passage Vero cells had several under-expressed and a few over-expressed genes compared to low-passage ones. Gene ontology revealed no significant enrichment of pathways related to oncogenic risk. These findings suggest that in  vitro high passage, and not culture conditions, induces Vero transformation correlated to karyotype and gene expression alterations. These data, together with previous investigations reporting tumour induction in high-passage Vero cells, suggest the use of low-passage Vero cells or cell lines other than Vero to increase the safety of vaccine manufacturing.

The complexity of these parasites can therefore cover the epidemiological issues of the interface between wild and domestic animals, especially once spatial overlap between wild and domestic definitive and intermediate hosts occurs. Here we use the occurrence of Taenia ovis krabbei in two model areas as an example of this epidemiological complexity. In two contiguous areas in the Italian northern Apennines, two hunted roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) showed numerous cysticerci in the muscles of their whole body and an adult tapeworm was  recorded in a semi-stray dog (Canis lupus familiaris). Through molecular typing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (cox1) gene, cysticerci and the adult tapeworm of T. krabbei were identified. Taenia krabbei cysticercosis was recorded for the first time in Italy. Although the role of dogs in the parasite's life cycle emerges, the overlap between wild and domestic definitive hosts and the increase of wild population densities raise concerns about the temporal (old or new) introduction and the spread of this parasite by one of these canid species (wolf (Canis lupus) or dog). Although T. krabbei is not a public health issue, economic concerns emerged for hunters and meat producers, related to the damage of carcasses by cysticerci. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the spread of  T. krabbei in the intermediate and definitive host populations, and to ensure the relevant sanitary education for hunters in order to avoid practices that could favour the spread and maintenance of its life cycle.

Electronic address:  anamaria.morenomartin@izsler.it.  Usutu virus is an arbovirus closely related to West Nile virus (genus Flavivirus), which circulates between mosquitoes and wild birds. This virus has been increasingly reported in Europe, raising concerns for its possible pathogenic potential for wild birds and humans. This study reports the whole genome sequences of 15 strains of USUV, isolated between 2010 and 2014 from mosquitoes and wild birds in the course of West Nile virus surveillance in the Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy regions of Northern Italy. Both whole and 656 partial genome sequences, obtained from isolated viruses and field samples (mosquitoes and wild birds), were analyzed to describe the temporal and geographical spread of USUV in the surveyed area. The detected sequences belonged to two groups, with one circulating primarily in the northwestern part of the area and the other in the southeastern part. This pattern is likely the result of different routes of introduction from the North (over the Alps) and from the East, respectively. The  phylogenetic analysis of obtained sequences and other European sequences demonstrated that the majority of European strains belonged to one main clade, while less common strains, mainly from Western Europe, fell in other two clades.  This analysis strongly suggested an autochthonous evolution process of strains of the main clade from a common ancestor with an estimated time of arrival in Europe at the beginning of the 1990s. In addition to causing mass mortality in wild birds, Usutu virus can infect humans and can sporadically cause disease. These factors and the endemization of the Usutu virus in a large area of Europe, sustained by the obtained data, strongly support the need to adequately survey Usutu virus in areas in which its circulation is detected.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a relevant pathogen causing human and animal infections, frequently displaying high levels of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials. The increasing difficulty to develop new effective antibiotics have discouraged investment in this area and only a few new antibiotics are currently under development. An approach to overcome antibiotic resistance could  be based on antimicrobial peptides since they offer advantages over currently used microbicides. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide AMP2041 was evaluated against 49 P. aeruginosa clinical strains with high levels of antimicrobial resistance, isolated from humans (n = 19) and animals (n = 30). In  vitro activity was evaluated by a microdilution assay for lethal dose 90% (LD90), while the activity over time was performed by time-kill assay with 12.5 µg/ml of  AMP2014. Evidences for a direct membrane damage were investigated on P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 reference strain, on animal isolate PA-VET 38 and on human  isolate PA-H 24 by propidium iodide and on P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: AMP2041 showed a dose-dependent activity, with a mean (SEM) LD90 of 1.69 and 3.3 µg/ml for animal and human strains, respectively. AMP2041 showed microbicidal activity on P. aeruginosa isolates from a patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and resistance increased from first infection isolate (LD90 = 0.3 μg/ml) to the mucoid phenotype (LD90 = 10.4 μg/ml). The time-kill assay showed a time-dependent bactericidal effect of AMP2041 and LD90 was reached within 20 min for all the strains. The stain-dead assay showed an increasing of membrane permeabilization and SEM analysis revealed holes, dents and bursts throughout bacterial cell wall after 30 min of incubation with AMP2041. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results assessed for the first time the good antimicrobial activity of AMP2041 on P. aeruginosa strains of human origin, including those deriving from a CF patient. We confirmed the excellent antimicrobial activity of AMP2041 on P. aeruginosa strains derived from dog otitis. We also assessed that AMP2041 antimicrobial activity is linked to changes of the P. aeruginosa cell wall morphology and to the increasing of membrane permeability.

Fresh vegetables and their ready-to-eat (RTE) salads have become increasingly recognized as potential vehicles for foodborne diseases. The EU Reg. 1441/2007 establishes microbiological criteria for bacterial pathogens for products placed  on the market during their shelf-life (i.e. Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes) for pre-cut fruits and vegetables (RTE) whilst it does not address the problem of contamination by enteric viruses. In this study we investigated the contamination by hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and norovirus (NoV) in 911 ready-to-eat vegetable samples taken from products at retail in Apulia and in Lombardia. The vegetable samples were tested using validated real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, ISO standardized virological methods and ISO culturing methods for bacteriological analysis. The total prevalence of HAV and HEV was 1.9% (18/911) and 0.6% (6/911), respectively. None of the samples analysed in this study was positive for NoV, Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes. The detection of HAV and HEV in RTE salads highlights a risk to consumers and the need to improve production hygiene. Appropriate implementation  of hygiene procedures is required at all the steps of the RTE vegetable production chain and this should include monitoring of emerging viral pathogens.  Copyright © 2017.

The calicivirus Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is widely used in Australia as a biocontrol agent to manage wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations. However, widespread herd immunity limits the effectiveness of the currently used strain, CAPM V-351. To overcome this, we developed an experimental platform for the selection and characterisation of novel RHDV strains. As RHDV does not replicate in cell culture, variant viruses were selected by serially passaging a highly virulent RHDV field isolate in immunologically naïve laboratory rabbits that were passively immunised 18-24 hours post-challenge with a neutralising monoclonal antibody. After seven passages, two amino acid substitutions in the P2 domain of the capsid protein became fixed within the virus population. Furthermore, a synonymous substitution  within the coding sequence of the viral polymerase appeared and was also maintained in all subsequent passages. These findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that RHDV evolution can be experimentally manipulated to select  for virus variants with altered phenotypes, in this case partial immune escape.

Morphological and molecular characterization of four Sarcocystis spp., including  Sarcocystis linearis n. sp., from roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Italy.

Bjorn.Gjerde@nmbu.no. (2)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Via Bianchi, 9-25124, Brescia, Italy.  Fresh (frozen/thawed) muscle samples from four 2-12-year-old roe deer (Capreolus  capreolus) from the Sondrio province in north-eastern Italy were examined under a dissecting microscope, and about 180 sarcocysts were isolated and identified to morphological type in wet mounts by light microscopy (LM). Seventy-seven of these sarcocysts were subsequently examined by molecular methods, comprising polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (cox1) of all isolates, as well as PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the complete18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of two isolates of each species found. By LM, three major sarcocyst types were recognised: spindle-shaped sarcocysts, 0.5-3 mm long, either with no clearly recognisable protrusions (thin-walled) or with finger-like protrusions (thick-walled); and slender, thread-like sarcocysts, 2-3 mm long, with hair-like  protrusions. Sequencing of cox1 revealed that the sarcocysts belonged to four different species. Those with no visible protrusions either belonged to Sarcocystis gracilis (n = 24) or to a Sarcocystis taeniata-like species (n = 19), whereas those with finger- and hair-like protrusions belonged to Sarcocystis silva (n = 27) and Sarcocystis capreolicanis (n = 7), respectively. The 19 cox1 sequences of the S. taeniata-like species, comprising five haplotypes, differed from each other at 0-16 of 1038 nucleotide positions (98.5-100% identity). They differed from 25 previous cox1 sequences of S. taeniata from moose and sika deer  (with 98.0-100% intraspecific identity), at 33-43 nucleotide positions (95.9-96.8% interspecific identity), and there were 20 fixed nucleotide differences between the two populations. In the phylogenetic analysis based on cox1 sequences, the two populations formed two separate monophyletic clusters. The S. taeniata-like species in roe deer was therefore considered to represent a  separate species, which was named Sarcocystis linearis n. sp. At the 18S rRNA gene, however, the two species could not be clearly separated from each other. Thus, there was considerable intraspecific sequence variation in the 18S rRNA gene of S. linearis (98.1-99.9% identity between 24 sequences), which was similar both in magnitude and nature to the variation previously found in this gene of S. taeniata. The new 18S rRNA gene sequences of S. linearis shared an identity of 97.9-99.6% with those of S. taeniata (overlap between intra- and interspecific identity), and in the phylogenetic tree, sequences of the two species were interspersed. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the sarcocysts of S. linearis were found to possess regularly spaced, thin and narrow ribbon-like cyst wall protrusions (about 2.8-3.2 μm long, 0.3-0.4 μm wide and about 0.02-0.03 μm thick), terminating in a plate-like structure of the same thickness but with an elliptic outline (about 0.3-0.4 μm wide and 0.7-0.9 μm long). The terminal plates were connected in the middle with the band-like portion of the protrusions like the board of a seesaw (tilting board). The terminal plates of adjacent protrusions were neatly arranged in a hexagonal pattern resembling tiles on a roof. Together, they formed an outer roof-like layer facing the surrounding cytoplasm of the host cell and completely covering the band-like proximal portion of the protrusions, which overlapped and were stacked in three to four layers close to the cyst surface. The sarcocyst morphology of S. linearis was consistent with that of an unnamed Sarcocystis sp. in roe deer previously found by transmission electron microscopy in several countries, including Italy. A few sarcocysts of S. gracilis and S. silva were also examined by SEM, confirming the  presence of regularly distributed, short knob-like protrusions in S. gracilis (as seen in previous SEM studies) and revealing tightly packed, erect 6-7-μm-long villus-like protrusions having regularly distributed round depressions on their surface in S. silva. The sequencing of cox1 of 7, 24 and 27 new isolates of S. capreolicanis, S. gracilis and S. silva, respectively, recovered 7, 11 and 10 new haplotypes from each of the three species and expanded our knowledge on the intraspecific sequence variation at this marker. Similarly, the study revealed a  more extensive intragenomic sequence variation at the 18S rRNA gene of S. capreolicanis and S. silva than known from previous studies and confirmed a near  absence of such variation in the 18S rRNA gene of S. gracilis.

Seven hundred seventy-eight samples of packaged smoked fish (774 smoked salmon and 4 smoked swordfish) on sale in Italy, from 50 different manufacturers located in 12 European Union countries, were purchased from the Italian market between May and December 2011. The surface temperatures of the samples on sale ranged from 0 to 13°C (3.4 ± 1.5°C, mean ± SD). Six hundred eighty (87.4%) of 778 samples were stored at ≤4°C. One hundred fifty-seven samples (20.2%, 95% confidence interval 17.5 to 23.1%) were contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes ,  with 26 samples (3.3%, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 4.8%) at levels >100 CFU/g. The maximum level of contamination was 1.3 ×106 CFU/g. The differences in the level of contamination of smoked fish between countries (χ2 = 91.54, P < 0.05) and manufacturers (χ2 = 193.22, P < 0.05) were significant. The frequency of detection for products from different manufacturing premises ranged from 0 to 76.9%. Serotyping by serological agglutination revealed that the main serotypes detected were 1/2a (65.3%) and 1/2b (22.4%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing with restriction enzymes AscI and ApaI yielded 36 pulsotypes from 144 isolates, clustering into 17 groups. Eight main pulsotypes accounted for 70.8% of the isolates. Three of the main pulsotypes were exclusively from products of a single manufacturer. In general, products from the same manufacturer showed genetic homogeneity, with one strongly prevalent pulsotype. Different manufacturers usually showed very different levels of contamination of the final  product, confirming the importance of the management of process hygiene for controlling L. monocytogenes contamination.

Real time PCR (quantitative PCR, qPCR) is now a well-established method for the detection, quantification, and typing of different microbial agents in the areas  of clinical and veterinary diagnostics and food safety. Although the concept of PCR is relatively simple, there are specific issues in qPCR that developers and users of this technology must bear in mind. These include the use of correct terminology and definitions, understanding of the principle of PCR, difficulties  with interpretation and presentation of data, the limitations of qPCR in different areas of microbial diagnostics and parameters important for the description of qPCR performance. It is not our intention in this review to describe every single aspect of qPCR design, optimization, and validation; however, it is our hope that this basic guide will help to orient beginners and users of qPCR in the use of this powerful technique.

We describe a case of severe swine influenza A(H1N1) virus infection in an immunocompetent middle-aged man in October 2016 in Italy who had only indirect exposure to pigs. The patient developed a severe acute distress respiratory syndrome which was successfully supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  and treated with antiviral therapy. The sole risk factor for influenza was a body mass index > 30 kg/m2. After a month of hospitalisation, the patient was discharged in good health.  This article is copyright of The Authors, 2017.

BACKGROUND: Two main genetic groups (B.12 and B.FTNF002-00) of Francisella tularensis ssp. holarctica are endemic in Europe. The B.FTNF002-00 group proved to be dominant in Western European countries, while strains of the B.12 group were isolated mainly in Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. The clinical course of tularemia in the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) also shows distinct patterns according to the geographical area. Acute course of the disease is observed in hares in Western European countries, while signs of sub-acute or chronic infection are more frequently detected in the eastern part of the continent. The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is any difference in the virulence of the strains belonging to the B.FTNF002-00 and B.12 genetic clades. RESULTS: Experimental infection of Fischer 344 rats was performed by intra-peritoneal injection of three dilutions of a Hungarian (B.12 genotype) and  an Italian (B.FTNF002-00 genotype) F. tularensis ssp. holarctica strain. Moderate difference was observed in the virulence of the two genotypes. Significant differences were observed in total weight loss values and scores of clinical signs between the two genotypes with more rats succumbing to tularemia in groups  infected with the B.FTNF002-00 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the experimental infection are consistent with previous clinical observations and pathological studies suggesting that F. tularensis ssp. holarctica genotype B.FTNF002-00 has higher pathogenic potential than the B.12 genotype.

Sporadic outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have occurred in Libya for almost fifty years. During the spring of 2013, a countrywide serosurvey was undertaken to assess the level of FMD virus circulation and identify FMD virus serotypes in the country. A total of 4221 sera were collected, comprising samples from large ruminants (LR; n=1428 samples from 357 farms) and small ruminants (SR; n=2793 samples from 141 farms). FMD sero-prevalence of NSP antibodies determined  by ELISA were 19.0% (271/1428) with 95% CI (16.9 - 21.0) and 13.5% (378/2793) with 95% CI (12.3 - 14.8) for LR and SR samples, respectively. The sero-prevalence of NSP antibodies in LR was 12.3% and 19.8% for age group < 1 year and ≥ 1 year, respectively (X2= 4.95, P= 0.026), while in SR was 3.7%, 13.6% and 21.3% for age group < 1 year, 1-2 year and > 2 year, respectively (X2= 118.1, P= 0.000). These observed NSP serologic profiles support the hypothesis of an endemic level of FMD circulation in Libya. All positive sera were tested for SP antibodies for O, A and SAT-2 FMD virus serotypes. Serotype O was the dominant circulating serotype followed by serotype A, while evidence of SAT-2 was not found. These data provide an insight into the wider epidemiology of FMD in Libya, and contribute to field and laboratory investigations that during 2013 serotype O (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage) was isolated from clinical samples collected from the  country.

The occurrence of virus belonging to the putative genus Influenzavirus D, has been demonstrated all-around the world arousing interest within the scientific community. Most of the published virological surveys are based on the first described Real-Time PCR method, designed on the PB1 gene of the first isolate. The necessity of extending investigation to different animal species and geographic areas, requires a continuous update of molecular tests, considering newly sequenced strains. Moreover, the availability of an alternative assay, is essential either to confirm data, or for ensuring the detection of the widest number of strains. A new Real-Time PCR, specific for influenza D virus (IDV), was developed and evaluated. The target sequences of primers and probe are highly conserved among IDV strains currently known. The specificity of the method was demonstrated in silico by BLAST, and in vitro with a huge panel of common swine and bovine respiratory pathogens. The analytical sensitivity of the Real-Time PCR was estimated through synthetic RNA molecules and the limit of detection was about 20 copies/μL. The assay was assessed in field and proved to be a valuable tool for the detection of IDV strains.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.01.019 	28153610

Listeria monocytogenes causes invasive syndromes with high fatality rates in specific population groups. Cheeses have been commonly implicated in outbreaks worldwide. Gorgonzola is a cheese only produced in Northwestern Italy (it is the  third Italian cheese in terms of production and export) and L. monocytogenes is frequently isolated from the production chain. The aims of this study were to assess the distribution of L. monocytogenes Virulence Types (VTs) in isolates collected in Gorgonzola processing plants and to determine the presence of Epidemic Clones (ECs). Fifty-Six L. monocytogenes strains collected between 2004  and 2016 from cheese and environmental samples were subtyped with Multi-Virulence-Locus Sequence Typing (MVLST) and compared to previously typed strains. Most isolates (n=50) belonged to two new VTs (VT113 and VT114). The remaining isolates belonged to previously identified VTs: VT14-ECVIII (milk chocolate outbreak, 1994, USA) and VT80 (ricotta salata outbreak, 2012, USA). VT14, VT80 and VT113 were shared with isolates from apparently sporadic human cases in the same geographical area and temporal period (Piedmont and Lombardy, 2005-2016). The overall L. monocytogenes population appears to be homogeneous and may be characteristic of Gorgonzola production. Nevertheless, the detection in cheese and environmental samples of VTs observed in clinical isolates or outbreak related strains (VT80, VT14) contributed to better describe the current scenario  and pointed out the need for increased surveillance.

Animals' exchanges are considered the most effective route of between-farm infectious disease transmission. However, despite being often overlooked, the infection spread due to contaminated equipment, vehicles, or personnel proved to  be important for several livestock epidemics. This study investigated the role of indirect contacts in a potential infection spread in the dairy farm network of the Province of Parma (Northern Italy). We built between-farm contact networks using data on cattle exchange (direct contacts), and on-farm visits by veterinarians (indirect contacts). We compared the features of the contact structures by using measures on static and temporal networks. We assessed the disease spreading potential of the direct and indirect network structures in the  farm system by using data on the infection state of farms by paratuberculosis. Direct and indirect networks showed non-trivial differences with respect to connectivity, contact distribution, and super-spreaders identification. Furthermore, our analyses on paratuberculosis data suggested that the contributions of direct and indirect contacts on diseases spread are apparent at  different spatial scales. Our results highlighted the potential role of indirect  contacts in between-farm disease spread and underlined the need for a deeper understanding of these contacts to develop better strategies for prevention of livestock epidemics.

The study aimed at investigating the main circumstances of death in dairy cows (euthanasia, emergency slaughter or unassisted death), the primary causes and the risk factors of death. Out of 251 dead cows involved (across 137 farms), 54.6% died assisted and 45.4% were found dead. The main causes of death were metabolic/digestive disorders (22.3%) and mastitis/udder problems (17.1%), while in 14.7% of all cases, reasons of death were unknown. From the univariable generalised linear mixed models, dry cows showed a significantly higher odds to die unassisted compared to lactating cows (OR=3.2); dry cows also had higher odds of dying from  unknown reasons (OR=11.7). Season was not significantly related to the risk of dying unassisted and for unknown reasons, but during the summer (characterised by hot and muggy weather in Northern Italy) cows died mostly for problems at calving. 54.2% of cows died during the first 30days in milk (DIM). Half of the multiparous cows that died, died in the first 29.5 DIM, while half of the primiparous cows that died, died in the first 50 DIM. Results pointed out that, especially in dry cows, around calving and during the summer, some failure in management practices and daily inspections may occur. Improvements should be done in monitoring activities and in recognising early symptoms of diseases among stockperson. In addition, in case of diagnosed diseases with poor prognosis, euthanasia procedures should be implemented to prevent cows from dying unassisted.  Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The key role of cell cultures in different scientific fields is worldwide recognized, both as in vitro research models alternative to laboratory animals and substrates for biological production. However, many safety concerns rise from the use of animal/human cell lines that may be tumorigenic, leading to potential  adverse contaminations in cell-derived biologicals. In order to evaluate the suitability of 13 different cell lines for Poliovirus vaccine production, safety  and quality, in vitro/in vivo tumorigenicity and Poliovirus propagation properties were evaluated. Our results revealed that non-human primate cell lines CYNOM-K1, FRhK-4, 4MBr-5 and 4647 are free of tumorigenic features and represent  highly susceptible substrates for attenuated Sabin Poliovirus strains. In particular, FRhK-4 and 4647 cell lines are characterized by a higher in vitro replication, resulting indicated for the use in large-scale production field.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e Dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER) Brescia, Italy.  The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes an acute and highly contagious  enteric disease characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and a high mortality rate in seronegative neonatal piglets. In the last few years, PED had a large economic impact on the swine industries in Asia and the US, and in 2014, the PEDV also re-emerged in Europe. Two main PEDV variants circulate worldwide but only the S INDEL variant, considered a mild strain, is spreading in Europe. To gain insights into the pathogenicity of this variant, its viral load and temporal shedding pattern were evaluated in piglets from infected farms. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting the spike gene, was validated according to the minimum information for quantitative real-time PCR experiments guidelines. The qPCR was applied to longitudinal studies conducted in four swine  farms naturally infected with the PEDV S INDEL variant. Clinical data, fecal swabs, and blood samples were collected from 103 piglets at 15-30-day intervals for 2-5 months. On all four farms, diarrhea was observed in sows during gestation and in farrowing units, and the mortality rates of piglets were 18, 25, 30, and 35%. Different clinical pictures (0-50% of diarrhea positivity), viral titer levels (mean 5.3-7.2 log10 genome copies/mL), and antibody conditions (30-80% of  positivity) were registered among sows on the four farms. The percentage of qPCR  positive piglets varied greatly from the beginning (63-100%) to the end (0%) of the infection course. Clinical signs were present in 96% of the qPCR positive animals. Viral loads ranged from 8.5 log10 to 4 log10 genome copies/mL in suckling pigs at 3-6 days of age and were not statistically different among farms, despite the different patterns observed in sows. After 2-3 weeks, only a few piglets still showed detectable viral levels and clinical signs, and they developed antibody responses. Moreover, co-infections with other pathogens and biosecurity procedures limiting the circulation of the virus could have influenced the severity of PED infection. QPCR and clinical data were useful in understanding the dynamics of PEDV infections and, therefore, in implementing appropriate control measures.

(4)University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.  Background. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum is endemic  in the Mediterranean area. In the last decades a northward spread of the parasite has been observed in Italy. This paper describes a VL outbreak in Modena province (Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy) between 2012 and 2015. Methods. Retrospective, observational study to evaluate epidemiological, microbiological characteristics, and clinical management of VL in patients referring to Policlinico Modena Hospital. Results. Sixteen cases of VL occurred in the study period. An immunosuppressive condition was present in 81.3%. Clinical presentation included  anemia, fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Serology was positive in 73.3% of cases, peripheral blood PCR in 92.3%, and bone marrow blood  PCR in 100%. Culture was positive in 3/6 cases (50%) and all the isolates were identified as L. infantum by ITS1/ITS2 sequencing. The median time between symptom onset and diagnosis was 22 days (range 6-131 days). All patients were treated with liposomal amphotericin b. 18.8% had a VL recurrence and were treated with miltefosine. Attributable mortality was 6.3%. Conclusions. VL due to L. infantum could determine periodical outbreaks, as the one described; thus it is important to include VL in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin, even in low-endemic areas.

Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) is a natural, collagen-based, osteoinductive biomaterial. Nevertheless, there are conflicting reports on the efficacy of this  product. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether DBM collagen structure is affected by particle size and can influence DBM cytocompatibility and osteoinductivity. Sheep cortical bone was ground and particles were divided in three fractions with different sizes, defined as large (L, 1-2 mm), medium (M, 0.5-1 mm), and small (S, <0.5 mm). After demineralization, the chemical-physical  analysis clearly showed a particle size-dependent alteration in collagen structure, with DBM-M being altered but not as much as DBM-S. DBM-M displayed a preferable trend in almost all biological characteristics tested, although all DBM particles revealed an optimal cytocompatibility. Subcutaneous implantation of DBM particles into immunocompromised mice resulted in bone induction only for DBM-M. When sheep MSC were seeded onto particles before implantation, all DBM particles were able to induce new bone formation with the best incidence for DBM-M and DBM-S. In conclusion, the collagen alteration in DBM-M is likely the best condition to promote bone induction in vivo. Furthermore, the choice of 0.5-1 mm particles may enable to obtain more efficient and consistent results among different research groups in bone tissue-engineering applications. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Simbu serogroup of orthobunyaviruses comprises a wide range of viruses with different medical and veterinary relevance. These viruses are known to reassort,  and coinfection of the same cell is one of the prerequisites for reassortment. Here, a mammalian cell line was infected with various members of this virus group, inoculated after several time points with a second Simbu serogroup virus,  and analyzed by strain or species specific immunofluorescence staining. Different virus species or different strains of the same virus species were able to co-infect mammalian cells, but only for a limited time frame. After a few hours,  the replication of the first virus led to a gradual inhibition of a second virus  until a complete resistance to superinfection after 24h regardless whether it is  another strain of the same virus species or a distinct member of the serogroup.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused extensive economic losses to pig producers in many countries. It was recently introduced, for the first time,  into North America and outbreaks have occurred again in multiple countries within Europe as well. To assess the properties of various diagnostic assays for the detection of PEDV infection, multiple panels of porcine sera have been shared and tested for the presence of antibodies against PEDV in an inter-laboratory ring trial. Different laboratories have used a variety of "in house" ELISAs and also one commercial assay. The sensitivity and specificity of each assay has been estimated using a Bayesian analysis applied to the ring trial results obtained with the different assays in the absence of a gold standard. Although different characteristics were found, it can be concluded that each of the assays used can  detect infection of pigs at a herd level by either the early European strains of  PEDV or the recently circulating strains (INDEL and non-INDEL). However, not all  the assays seem suitable for demonstrating freedom from disease in a country. The results from individual animals, especially when the infection has occurred within an experimental situation, show more variation.  Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Electronic address: Tanja.Opriessnig@roslin.ed.ac.uk.  Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused economic losses in the Americas, Asia and Europe in recent years. Reliable serological assays are essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  (ELISAs) to detect antibodies against different PEDV strains in pig serum. A total of 732 serum samples from North American or European pigs were tested. Samples included experimental samples from pigs infected with classical (G1a PEDV) or variant genogroup 1 PEDV (G1b PEDV), pandemic genogroup 2 PEDV (G2b PEDV) or non-infected controls. Field samples from herds with confirmed or unknown PEDV exposure were also used. Three indirect ELISAs based on G2b antigens (ELISAs 1, 2 and 3), a competitive ELISA based on the G2b antigen (ELISA 4) and a competitive ELISA based on the G1a antigen (ELISA 5) were compared. Overall, the  tests had a moderate agreement (κ=0.61). G1a PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISA 3, G1b PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISAs 4 and 5 and the performance of all tests was similar for the G2b PEDV group. ELISA  1 showed the overall lowest detection on experimentally and field derived samples. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with a 95% probability interval were estimated to be 68.2% (62.1-74.4%) and 97.5% (95.2-99.0%) for ELISA 1, 73.7% (71.5-79.6%) and 98.4% (96.6-99.5%) for ELISA 2, 86.2% (81.1-90.6%) and 91.6% (87.7-94.8%) for ELISA 3, 78.3% (72.8-83.5%) and 99.7% (98.2-100%) for ELISA 4, and 93.5% (90.3-96.0%) and 91.2% (83.8-97.9%) for ELISA 5. Differences in detection among assays seem to be more related to intrinsic factors of an assay than to the PEDV antigen used.  Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most severe diseases of pigs; it has a drastic impact on the pig industry, causing serious socio-economic consequences to pig farmers and pork producers. In Europe, there are currently two main clusters of infection; one in Sardinia caused by strains of African swine fever virus (ASFV) belonging to genotype I and another in Eastern Europe caused by strains of ASFV belonging to genotype II. The latter is inducing an acute form of ASF and it represents a serious threat to the pig sector. ASF is a disease for which there is no effective vaccine; therefore, prevention has a pivotal role in  the control strategy of the disease. This review describes the main preventive measures to adopt to mitigate the risk of ASF spread in pig farming systems.  DOI: 10.1186/s13028-016-0264-x  PMCID: PMC5129245	27899125

BACKGROUND: The Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a small, non enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA virus in the genus Cardiovirus, family Picornaviridae, with two known serotypes. It is spread worldwide and infects a huge range of vertebrate hosts with zoonotic potential for humans. The pig is the mammal most likely to be impacted on with the disease, but EMCV occurrence has also been reported in non-human primates and in a variety of domestic, captive and wild animals. Until now, human cases have been very rare and the risk appears to be almost negligible in spite of human susceptibility to the infection. CASE PRESENTATION: Between September and November 2012 a fatal Encephalomyocarditis virus outbreak involving four Barbary macaques and 24 crested porcupines occurred at a rescue centre for wild and exotic animals in Central Italy. In this open-field zoo park located near Grosseto, Tuscany about 1000 animals belonging to different species, including various non-human primates were hosted at that time. Sudden deaths were generally observed without any evident symptoms or only with mild nonspecific clinical signs. The major gross change was characterised by grey-white necrotic foci in the myocardium and the same EMCV strain was isolated both in macaques and crested porcupines. Phylogenetic analysis has confirmed that only one EMCV strain is circulating in Italy, capable of infecting different animal species. CONCLUSIONS: This report confirms the susceptibility of non-human primates to the EMCV infection and describes the disease in porcupine, a common wild Italian and  African species. No human cases were observed, but given the zoonotic potential of EMCV these findings are of importance in the context of animal-human interface.

AIMS: The aim of the study was to explore the suitability of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for a rapid and correct identification of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) field isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: MALDI-TOF MS approach is becoming one of the most popular tests for the identification of intact bacterial cells which has been shown to be fast and reliable. For this purpose, 36 MAP field isolates were analysed through  MALDI-TOF MS and the spectra compared with two different databases: one provided  by the vendor of the system employed (Biotyper ver. 3·0; Bruker Daltonics) and a  homemade database containing spectra from both tuberculous and nontuberculous Mycobacteria. Moreover, principal component analysis procedure was employed to confirm the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to discriminate between very closely related  subspecies. Our results suggest MAP can be differentiated from other Mycobacterium species, both when the species are very close (M. intracellulare) and when belonging to different subspecies (M. avium ssp. avium and M. avium ssp. silvaticum). CONCLUSIONS: The procedure applied is fast, easy to perform, and achieves an earlier accurate species identification of MAP and nontuberculous Mycobacteria in comparison to other procedures. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The gold standard test for the diagnosis of paratuberculosis is still isolation of MAP by cultural methods, but additional assays, such as qPCR and subculturing for determination of mycobactin dependency  are required to confirm its identification. We have provided here evidence pertaining to the usefulness of MALDI-TOF MS approach for a rapid identification  of this mycobacterium among other members of M. avium complex.  © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

Dairy products can harbor various microorganisms (e.g., Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli) arising from animal reservoirs, and which can become important sources of foodborne illness. Therefore, early detection of food pathogens is crucial to prevent diseases. We wished to develop an accurate quantitative protocol based on a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) involving eight individual TaqMan™ reactions to detect simultaneously, without selective enrichment, Listeria spp., L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., verocytotoxin-producing E. coli and Campylobacter spp. in cheese. ddPCR (a "third-generation PCR") provides absolute quantification of target DNAs without requirement of a standard curve, which simplifies experimentation and data comparability. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the developed ddPCR system were assessed using purified DNA from 50 reference pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains from international or Italian collections and analyzing soft cheese samples artificially contaminated with serial dilutions (from 4 × 106 to 4 × 101 CFU/g) of pure cultures from the American Type Culture Collection. Finally, the performance of our ddPCR system was compared by parallel testing with quantitative PCR: it gave higher sensitivity (102 CFU/g for the Listeria spp. assay) without the necessity of a standard curve. In conclusion, this is the first ddPCR system developed for simultaneous detection of common foodborne pathogens in cheese using a single set of amplification conditions. As such, it could become a useful strategy for high-throughput screening of microorganisms to evaluate the quality and safety of food products.

In addition, milk and milk-products  contaminated by Staph. aureus can cause harmful human diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize Staph. aureus strains isolated from dairy farms in Tunisia. Bulk tank milk (n = 32) and individual cow milk (n = 130) samples were collected during the period of 2013-2014. Forty-three Staph. aureus isolates were recovered and typed by spa typing, 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (RS-PCR) and multiplex PCRs for 22 virulence genes. Antimicrobial resistance was also investigated with a disc diffusion test. A selected subsample of 22 strains was additionally genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. Seventeen spa types were recovered, and t2421 (n = 10), t521 (n = 6) and t2112 (n = 5) were the most common. Fourteen different RS-PCR genotypes grouped into 11 clusters were detected in our study, with predominance of the RVI genotype (n = 24). Eight sequence types were identified and Clonal Complex 97, corresponding to RS-PCR cluster R, was the most common (n = 10), followed by CC1 (n = 4), CC15 (n = 3) and other four accounting for one or two strains. Different combinations of virulence genes were reported, and enterotoxin genes were present in few strains  (seh, n = 4; sea, n = 2; sea and seh, n = 2; sec and sel, n = 2). The majority of strains were resistant only to penicillin; only one strain was found to be multiresistant and no methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus was demonstrated. Our study reported the isolation of CC97 from bovine milk in Tunisia for the first time and confirmed the relevance of this lineage in intramammary infection in cows.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This paper describes the characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bulk tank and individual cow milk in Tunisia. All strains were genotyped by spa typing and RS-PCR, a method based on the amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region, and multiplex PCRs for 22 virulence genes. A selected subsample of strains was also genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. All strains were tested for antimicrobial resistance. Our study evidences a predominance of strains belonging to Clonal Complex 97. Methicillin-resistant strains were not detected, and overall low level of antimicrobial resistance was reported.  © 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology.  DOI: 10.1111/lam.12672 	27657910

The Culex pipiens complex includes species with reported differences in vector competence for arthropod-borne viruses, many of which are of significant importance to human health such as the West Nile virus and the Sindbis virus. This group of mosquitoes is difficult to distinguish morphologically; particularly as adult females. In Europe, the two species of the complex, Culex pipiens Linnaeus 1758 and Culex torrentium Martini 1925, are often found sympatrically. With the aim to characterize the presence and spread of both species in the Emilia-Romagna region, Northern Italy, mosquitoes of the complex - collected during the West Nile virus surveillance plans - were tested by multiplex real-time PCR for the detection of the two species Cx. pipiens and Cx. torrentium. A total of 24 165 mosquitoes, collected between 2012 and 2014 from 105 sites, and sorted in 204 pools, were tested. All tested pools were found to be composed of Cx. pipiens, whereas Cx. torrentium was not detected. These results indicate a likely absence of Cx. torrentium mosquitoes within the surveyed territory, whereas Cx. pipiens is widely distributed in the area mentioned. This is in line with previous reports, which describe a pre-alpine distribution of Cx. torrentium in Italy.  © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society.  DOI: 10.1111/mve.12186 	27477051

Electrospray Ionization and collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry are usually employed to obtain compound identification through a mass spectra match. Different algorithms have been developed for this purpose (for example the nist match algorithm). These approaches compare the tandem mass  spectra of the unknown analyte with the tandem mass spectra spectra of known compounds inserted in a database. The compounds are usually identified on the basis of spectral match value associated with a probability of recognition. However, this approach is not usually applied to multiple reaction monitoring transition spectra achieved by means of triple quadrupole apparatus, mainly due to the lack of a transition spectra database. The Surface Activated Chemical Ionization-Electrospray-NIST Bayesian model database search (SANIST) platform has been recently developed for new potential metabolite biomarker discovery, to confirm their identity and to use them for clinical and diagnostic applications.  Here, we present an improved version of the SANIST platform that extends its application to forensic, pharmaceutical, and food analysis studies, where the compound identification rules are strict. The European Union (EU) has set directives for compound identification (EU directive 2002/657/EC). We have applied the SANIST method to identification of 11-nor-9-carboxytetrahydro-cannabinol in urine samples (an example of a forensic  application), circulating levels of the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus in blood (an example of a pharmaceutical application) and glyphosate in fruit juice  (an example of a food analysis application) that meet the EU directive requirements.

Infectious bronchitis is considered to be one of the most devastating diseases in poultry. Control of its spread is typically attempted through biosecurity measures and extensive vaccination. However, the remarkable genetic and antigenic variability of the virus, which originate from both mutations and recombination events, represents an unsolved challenge for this disease. The present study reports on the emergence and spread of recombinant clusters detected in Italy and Spain between 2012 and 2014. A total of 36 Spanish and Italian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field strains were investigated and genetically characterized using phylogenetic, molecular, recombination and selection pressure analyses of the complete S1 gene. Based on the partial S1 sequencing, 27 IBV strains originating from Spain and nine from Italy were initially classified as being closely related to the Guandong/Xindadi (XDN) genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene revealed that the XDN strains formed a homogeneous clade with the Spanish IBV isolates within the QX genotype, whereas there was higher variability within the Italian strains. Recombination analysis determined that these strains belonged to four groups, which originated from independent recombination events between the QX and 793B IBV genotypes. Our data  support the hypothesis of two different scenarios: firstly, in Spain, the large and homogeneous clade probably originated from a single offspring of the recombinant founder, which became dominant and spread throughout the country. Secondly, the nine Italian recombinants, which are characterized by three different recombination patterns, probably represent less fitted strains, because they were less viable with respect to their recombinant parents.

Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1 in Italy is characterized by high genetic diversity, with at least 20 subtypes. Subtype 1f is endemic in a restricted geographic area, meaning that it has local distribution. We investigated the population dynamics of BVDV-1f in Northern Italy and characterized the transmission chains of a subset of samples from Piedmont and Aosta Valley regions. A total of 51 samples from 1966 to 2013 were considered and 5' UTR sequences were used for phylogeography. A subset of 12 samples was selected for Npro gene sequencing and further characterization of the transmission chains using both molecular and epidemiological data. Phylogeography estimated the root of BVDV-1f tree in Veneto in 1965. Four significant subclades  included sequences clustering by region: Lombardy (n=3), Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna (n=7), Piedmont (n=17), Piedmont and Aosta Valley (n=21). The Piedmont-only subclade has a ladder-like branching structure, while the Piedmont  and Aosta Valley subclade has a nearly complete binary structure. In the subset,  the outbreak reconstruction identified one sample from Piedmont as the most probable source of infection for the Aosta Valley cases. An ad hoc questionnaire  submitted to public veterinarians revealed connections between sampled and non-sampled farms by means of trades, exhibitions and markets. According to the phylogeography, BVDV-1f moved westward, entering from Veneto, and spreading to Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna in the early 1990s, and finally to Piedmont and Aosta Valley in the first decade of 2000s. Both phylogeographic analyses on the whole dataset and on the selection of Npro dataset pointed out that subtype 1f entered  Aosta Valley from Piedmont. The integration of molecular and epidemiological data revealed connections between farms, and such approach should be considered in any control plan. In Aosta Valley, the study showed that BVDV1f can be controlled only monitoring the introduction of cattle from Piedmont region.  Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This work investigated the effects of mercury chloride (HgCl2 ) acute exposure on virgin, pregnant and lactating rats by determination of renal and hepatic morphological and ultrastructural parameters and the expression of oxidative stress and stress tolerance markers, due to kidney and liver are the organs that  more accumulate inorganic mercury. Adult Wistar rats virgin (90 days old), pregnant (18th gestation day) and lactating (7th lactation day) were injected once with HgCl2 (5 mg/kg) or saline (controls). We observed that HgCl2 exposure of virgin rats caused significant inflammatory infiltration and severe morphological variations, like glomeruli atrophy, dilatation of Bowman's capsule, tubular degeneration and hepatocytes alteration. Moreover, virgin rats presented  mitochondrial modification, important oxidative stress and increase in stress tolerance proteins at both kidney and liver level, compared with virgin controls. In detail, virgin rats exposed to HgCl2 presented significantly elevated level of inducible nitric oxide synthase, heat shock protein 27 and glucose regulated proteins 75 expressions at both renal tubular and hepatocytes level, respect untreated virgin rats. Interestingly, pregnant and lactating rats exposed to HgCl2 presented weak renal and liver morphological alterations, showing weak inflammatory infiltration and no significant difference in structural mitochondrial transmembrane protein, oxidative stress markers and stress tolerance proteins expressions respect controls (virgin, pregnant and lactating rats). Although, both control and HgCl2 -exposed pregnant and lactating rats showed renal glomeruli greater in diameter respect virgin rats. In conclusion, we believe that virgin rats are more sensitive to HgCl2 toxicity respect pregnant and lactating rats. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a lagovirus that can cause fatal hepatitis (rabbit haemorrhagic disease, RHD) with mortality of 80-90% in farmed and wild rabbits. Since 1986, RHDV has caused outbreaks in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Europe, but never in European brown hares (Lepus europaeus, EBH). In 2010, a new RHDV-related virus, called RHDV2, emerged in Europe, causing extended epidemics because it largely overcame the immunity to RHDV present in most rabbit populations. RHDV2 also was identified in Cape hare (Lepus capensis subsp. mediterraneus) and in Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus). Here, we describe two distinct incidents of RHDV2 infection in EBH that occurred in Italy (2012) and Spain (2014). The two RHDV2 strains caused macroscopic and microscopic lesions similar to European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) in hares, and they were genetically related to other RHDV2 strains in Europe. EBHs are common in Europe,  often sharing habitat with rabbits. They likely have been exposed to high levels  of RHDV2 during outbreaks in rabbits in recent years, yet only two incidents of RHDV2 in EBHs have been found in Italy and Spain, suggesting that EBHs are not a  primary host. Instead, they may act as spillover hosts in situations when infection pressure is high and barriers between rabbits and hares are limited, resulting in occasional infections causing EBHS-like lesions. The serological survey of stocked hare sera taken from Italian and Spanish hare populations provided an understanding of naturally occurring RHDV2 infection in the field confirming its sporadic occurrence in EBH. Our findings increase the knowledge on distribution, host range and epidemiology of RHDV2.  © 2016 The Authors. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases Published by Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

Yersiniosis is the third most common reported zoonoses in Europe, with Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis responsible for 98.66% and 0.94% of the  confirmed human cases in 2013. From June 2013 to October 2014, 201 pigs at slaughter belonging to 67 batches were tested for Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis in tonsils. Diaphragm muscle samples were tested for antibodies against Yersinia by a commercially available ELISA test. Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 was detected in 55/201 pig tonsils (27.4%; 95% CI 23.1-37.1). The positive pigs came from 38/67 batches (56.7%) and were reared in  36/61 farms (59.0%). There was no statistical difference between farrow-to-finish and finishing farms. The mean count of Y. enterocolitica was 3.56±0.85log10CFU/g  with a minimum of 2.0log10CFU/g and a maximum of 4.78log10CFU/g. Y. pseudotuberculosis was isolated from 4/201 pig tonsils (2.0%; 95% CI 0.0-4.5). Three isolates belonged to serotype O:3 and one to serotype O:1. The positive pigs belonged to 4/67 batches (6.0%) and came from finishing farms only. Y. pseudotuberculosis could be enumerated in one sample only (4.27log10CFU/g). The ELISA test demonstrated that 56.1% of the meat juice samples were positive for Yersinia antibodies. Serological positivity was found in 67.9% (36/53) of the Y.  enterocolitica- and 75.0% (3/4) of the Y. pseudotuberculosis positive pigs. A significant association was found between serological results and the presence of Y. enterocolitica in tonsils (OR=1.97, p=0.044). All the Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3  isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, ceftazidime, ertapenem and meropenem, 94.5% to cefotaxime, 89.1% to kanamycin and 78.2% to tetracycline. The highest resistance rates were observed for ampicillin  (100%), sulphonamides (98.2%) and streptomycin (78.2%). Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested, i.e. amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, azithromycin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, sulphonamide, tetracycline and ticarcillin. The study shows that Italian fattening pigs are frequently infected with human pathogenic Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3. Although the isolation rate is slightly lower than in other European countries, the serological test demonstrates that the infection is widespread among pig population. In fact, seroprevalence is similar  to other EU countries. The detection of Y. pseudotuberculosis serotypes O:1 and O:3 in pig tonsils is of concern. Since tonsils may represent a contamination source for pig meat at slaughter, further studies regarding human infections by both microbial species are strongly recommended.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in many regions of the world and is one of the most prevalent epizootic animal diseases. FMD affects livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, and causes enormous economic losses due to reduced productivity and trade restrictions. Preparedness and early diagnosis are essential for effective control of FMD. Many diagnostic assays are dependent on raising high-affinity, anti-FMD virus (FMDV) serotype-specific antibodies in small animals (rabbits and guinea pigs) that give broad virus coverage. Here we show that soluble, truncated forms of bovine αvβ6 bind FMDV in an authentic RGD and divalent cation dependent interaction and can be used as the trapping reagent in a FMDV sandwich ELISA. In addition, inclusion of FLAG or His tags facilitates  simple purification without the loss of virus binding. We also provide evidence that when combined with a guinea pig polyclonal serum, or serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies, the integrin can be used to detect viruses representative  of all FMDV serotypes. We also show that recombinant FMDV empty capsids, with stabilising disulphide bonds, can serve as an antigen in the ELISA and can therefore replace inactivated virus antigen as a positive control for the assay.  Our results demonstrate the potential use of bovine αvβ6 and FMDV empty capsids in FMD diagnostic assays.  DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0160696  PMCID: PMC4975482	27494135

Staphylococcus aureus is the most important causative agent of subclinical mastitis in cattle resulting in reduced milk production and quality. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains has a clear zoonotic relevance, especially in the case of occupational exposure. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA in bulk tank milk (BTM) from dairy  cattle herds in the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy) and to identify the main MRSA circulating genotypes. MRSA strains were characterized by susceptibility testing, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing and SCCmec typing. A total 844 BTM samples were analysed and S. aureus and MRSA were detected in 47·2% and 3·8% of dairy herds, respectively. MLST showed that the majority (28/32) of isolates belonged to the typical livestock-associated lineages: ST398, ST97 and ST1. Interestingly, in this study we report for the first time the new ST3211, a  single locus variant of ST(CC)22, with the newly described 462 aroE allele. Our study indicates high diffusion of S. aureus mastitis and low, but not negligible, prevalence of MRSA in the considered area, suggesting the need for planning specific control programmes for bovine mastitis caused by S. aureus, especially when MRSA is implicated.

Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of zoonotic importance for which control and eradication programmes have been carried out in many countries for decades. While the impact of these programmes on public health is still uncertain, the impact on trade is significant because of movement restrictions for animals, costs of testing and culling. The objective of this systematic review was to provide a contribution to the general debate over costs against benefits for the  control and eradication of bovine TB in cattle. The search strategy was performed on four electronic databases following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The selection process, data abstraction and quality appraisal were carried out according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The search identified 66 articles out of which eight fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The evidence gathered in this review by combining the conclusions of the most methodologically sound articles supports the idea that, when multiple cost and benefit components are taken into account,  efforts to control or eradicate bovine TB may be effective in reducing disease prevalence, economically viable and worth doing.

Reproductive failure in sows is one of the most important factors affecting pig breeding. Many reproductive disorders are linked to both environmental factors and infectious agents. The goal of our study was to determine the presence of pathogens that are known to cause abortion, considering a set of conditioning factors, such as seasonality and pregnancy period. A large number of aborted fetuses (1,625 fetuses from 140 farms) from a high-density breeding area in northern Italy was analyzed for a period of 3 years. The pigs were diagnosed based on direct (culture, PCR) or indirect (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) evidence. An infectious etiologic agent was found in 323 of 549 cases of abortion (58.8%). These included viral agents (Porcine circovirus-2, 138/323; Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, 108/323; porcine parvovirus, 20/323; pseudorabies virus, 6/323; and Encephalomyocarditis virus, 3/323) and bacteria (Escherichia coli, 64/323; Streptococcus sp., 63/323; Staphylococcus sp., 5/323;  Pasteurella sp., 3/323; Shigella sp., 1/323; and Yersinia sp., 1/323). This study describes the prevalence of infectious agents involved in reproductive failure in a high-density swine population. The data can be useful to swine breeders, practitioners, and medical specialists in monitoring animal health and in supervising the breeding process.  © 2016 The Author(s).

From 1 May 2015 to 31 October 2015 over 20 million visitors from all over the world visited the Universal Exhibition (EXPO) hosted by Milan (Lombardy region, Italy), raising concerns about the possible introduction of mosquito-borne diseases from endemic countries. The entomological surveillance protocol performed in Lombardy over the last three years was implemented in the EXPO area  and in the two major regional airports using both Center for Disease Control CO₂  and Biogents Sentinel traps. This surveillance aimed to estimate the presence and densities of putative vectors, and also to support investigations, including the  vector species involved and area of diffusion, on the local spread of Chikungunya, Dengue and West Nile viruses (WNV) by competent vectors. From 3544 mosquitoes belonging to five different species, 28 pools of Culex spp. and 45 pools of Aedes spp. were screened for the presence of WNV, and for both Chikungunya and flaviviruses, respectively. The entomological surveillance highlighted a low density of potential vectors in the surveyed areas and did not  reveal the presence of Chikungunya or Dengue viruses in the local competent vectors inside the EXPO area or in the two airports. In addition, the surveillance reported a low density of Culex spp. mosquitoes, which all tested negative for WNV.  DOI: 10.3390/ijerph13070689  PMCID: PMC4962230	27399756

BACKGROUND: A diversifying pool of mammalian-adapted influenza A viruses (IAV) with largely unknown zoonotic potential is maintained in domestic swine populations worldwide. The most recent human influenza pandemic in 2009 was caused by a virus with genes originating from IAV isolated from swine. Swine influenza viruses (SIV) are widespread in European domestic pig populations and evolve dynamically. Knowledge regarding occurrence, spread and evolution of potentially zoonotic SIV in Europe is poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: Efficient SIV surveillance programmes depend on sensitive and specific diagnostic methods which allow for cost-effective large-scale analysis. METHODS: New SIV haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtype- and lineage-specific multiplex real-time RT-PCRs (RT-qPCR) have been developed and validated with reference virus isolates and clinical samples. RESULTS: A diagnostic algorithm is proposed for the combined detection in clinical samples and subtyping of SIV strains currently circulating in Europe that is based on a generic, M-gene-specific influenza A virus RT-qPCR. In a second step, positive samples are examined by tetraplex HA- and triplex NA-specific RT-qPCRs to differentiate the porcine subtypes H1, H3, N1 and N2. Within the HA subtype H1, lineages "av" (European avian-derived), "hu" (European  human-derived) and "pdm" (human pandemic A/H1N1, 2009) are distinguished by RT-qPCRs, and within the NA subtype N1, lineage "pdm" is differentiated. An RT-PCR amplicon Sanger sequencing method of small fragments of the HA and NA genes is also proposed to safeguard against failure of multiplex RT-qPCR subtyping. CONCLUSIONS: These new multiplex RT-qPCR assays provide adequate tools for sustained SIV monitoring programmes in Europe.  © 2016 The Authors.

The eradication of tuberculosis, brucellosis and leucosis in cattle has not yet been achieved in the entire Italian territory. The region of Lazio, Central Italy, represents an interesting case study to evaluate the evolution of costs for these eradication programmes, as in some provinces the eradication has been officially achieved, in some others the prevalence has been close to zero for years, and in still others disease outbreaks have been continuously reported. The objectives of this study were i) to describe the costs for the eradication programmes for tuberculosis, brucellosis and leucosis in cattle carried out in Lazio between 2007 and 2011, ii) to calculate the ratio between the financial contribution of the European Union (EU) for the eradication programmes and the estimated total costs and iii) to estimate the potential savings that can be made when a province gains the certification of freedom from disease. For the i) and ii) objectives, data were collected from official sources and a costing procedure was applied from the perspective of the Regional Health Service. For the iii) objective, a Bayesian AR(1) regression was used to evaluate the average percentage reduction in costs for a province that gained the certification. The total cost for the eradication programmes adjusted for inflation to 1 January 2016 was estimated at 18 919 797 euro (5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution: 18 325 050-19 552 080 euro). When a province gained the certification of freedom from disease, costs decreased on average by (median of the posterior distribution) 47.5%, 54.5% and 54.9% for the eradication programmes of tuberculosis, brucellosis and leucosis, respectively. Information on possible  savings from the reduction of control costs can help policy makers operating under budget constraints to justify the use of additional resources for the final phase of eradication.  © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

An increase in autochthonous hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections has been recorded in Italy suspected to be zoonotically transmitted from pigs; this study was carried out to determinate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with hepatitis HEV exposition, both in swine and humans working in pig farms, located  within a high-density pig farming area in Piedmont region, north-western Italy. The presence of viral RNA in human and swine samples was also evaluated, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on HEV-positive samples. Forty-two swine farms were sampled; 142 workers were enrolled in the study and classified into two groups: (i) 69 workers with occupational contact with swine (including veterinarians and farmers) recruited in the 42 sampled farms; (ii) 73 without occupational contact with swine. Forty-one of 42 (97%) swine farms resulted positive to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for HEV antibodies (Abs). Overall seroprevalence in swine was 50% (441/879), with seropositivity rate higher in sows (333/469, 71%). HEV RNA in stool samples was detected in animals from 13 of 42 tested farms (31%), and a higher positivity resulted in weaners (40/246, 16.3%). Phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates within genotype 3 (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All humans were negative for HEV viral genome in blood. Five of 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV with an overall prevalence of 3.52% with no statistically significant differences in prevalence rates between workers at zoonotic risk and the control group (5.7% versus 1.3%).  In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1) was observed within the subgroup  including subjects exposed for short periods (veterinarians) compared with those  who worked for long periods (farmers) suggesting a correlation between the time of exposure and the likelihood of HEV infection. Reporting HEV infection is not mandatory in Italy, but a constant epidemiological surveillance should be ensured to clarify the epidemiology of this disease.  © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

INTRODUCTION: Salmonella is a ubiquitous pathogen that can infect host species, like wild birds, rodents, and/or arthropods, which may transmit infection to domestic animals and human population. AIM: In order to assess the related risk, a cross-sectional study was performed on 1114 carcasses of wild animals from a north-eastern area of the Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During post mortem examination, intestine samples were cultured. A statistical analysis demonstrated that there is no correlation between the presence of sub-clinically infected animals and greater human population density. In contrast, a significant correlation between the number of  carcasses positive for Salmonella spp. and greater spatial density of pig, poultry, and cattle farms was observed (p < 0.01). RESULTS: The results of the present study show that wild animals with omnivorous  feeding habits are particularly exposed to Salmonella colonization and, consequently, to spreading the organism. Regarding drug resistance, this study confirms the resistance to antimicrobials is increasing in commensal and environmental isolates.  DOI: 10.4415/ANN_16_02_21 	27364404

Bovine mastitis caused by Prototheca is a serious and complex problem that accounts for high economic losses in the dairy industry. The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize at genetic level different Prototheca strains and provide the most complete data about protothecal antibiotic resistance. The study involves 46 isolates from Italian (13 strains) and Brazilian (33 strains) mastitic milk. These strains were identified by multiplex  PCR and single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. Moreover, biofilm production and antibiotic susceptibility were evaluated. Forty-two strains resulted as Prototheca zopfii genotype 2, whereas 4 isolates could belong to a potential new  Prototheca species. The RAPD-PCR, performed with 3 primers (M13, OPA-4, and OPA-18), showed a notable heterogeneity among isolates and grouped the strains according to the species and geographical origin. Biofilm production was species-dependent and P. zopfii genotype 2 strains were classified as strong biofilm producers. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that Prototheca strains were susceptible to antibacterial drugs belonging to aminoglycosides group; the highest activity against Prototheca strains was observed in the case of colistin sulfate, gentamicin, and netilmicin (100% of susceptible strains). It is interesting to note that all the Italian P. zopfii genotype 2 strains showed lower minimum inhibitory concentration values than the  Brazilian ones. Nisin showed more efficacy than lysozyme and potassium sorbate, inhibiting 31% of the strains. Results obtained in this study confirmed that RAPD-PCR is a rapid, inexpensive, and highly discriminating tool for Prototheca strains characterization and could give a good scientific contribution for better understanding the protothecal mastitis in dairy herd.

Wild ruminants have an important role in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis  (bTB). This study describes an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis occurring in a fallow deer herd in Sicily. In 2012 a Sicilian herd of 47 animals was referred for cachexia. Pathological examination of 2 dead animals revealed disseminated granulomas predominantly involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Tissue samples were submitted for histological analysis, bacteriological culture, and biomolecular assay. PCR analysis identified Mycobacterium strains. Genotyping by  spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR profiles identified Mycobacterium bovis spoligotype SB0120 in both animals. In 2014, bTB skin testing of 28 fallow deer from the same group was positive in 4 and inconclusive in another 4. All 8 positive/inconclusive reactors were euthanized. Disseminated granulomatous lesions were noted in 6 of these animals, 3 of which (2 positive and 1 negative to skin tests) also presented cutaneous lesions. M. bovis spoligotype SB0120 was  identified from all animals in which tuberculous-like lesions were observed, including 2 negative reactors. Many of the animals involved in this outbreak presented diffuse skin lesions, a potential route of transmission of M. bovis infection. Given the epidemiological role wildlife play in the maintenance of bTB infection and its potential risk for humans, a comprehensive monitoring plan for  this zoonosis in wildlife species in Sicily is needed.

The objective of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of 73 isolates of Mycoplasma bovis isolated from milk of dairy cattle herds of Belgium, Germany, and Italy. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined by the microbroth dilution method for the following  antimicrobials: erythromycin, spiramycin, tilmicosin, tylosin, lincomycin, enrofloxacin, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, florfenicol, and tiamulin. Macrolides, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, and enrofloxacin, were chosen because they represent antimicrobials families commonly used in several countries for treatment of M. bovis, and their MIC values in cattle population are reported in  several studies, allowing a comparison with previous data. Doxycycline and tiamulin were selected to assess the susceptibility of M. bovis to new antimicrobials, because they are not registered in the European Union for the treatment of dairy cattle. Among the agents of the different antimicrobial classes, the macrolides showed the highest concentration to inhibit 90% of isolates (MIC90), all above the highest concentration tested: >8μg/mL for erythromycin, >16μg/mL for spiramycin, and >32μg/mL for tilmicosin and tylosin. Also the MIC90 of lincomycin was above the highest concentration tested (>32μg/mL), but the distribution of the MIC values was almost perfectly bimodal:  41 isolates had a MIC ≤0.5μg/mL and 30 isolates >32μg/mL. Oxytetracycline had a 2-fold higher concentration to inhibit 50% of isolates (2 vs. 0.5μg/mL) and 1-fold higher MIC90 (4 vs. 2μg/mL) than doxycycline. Enrofloxacin and florfenicol had both a MIC90 of 2μg/mL, whereas tiamulin had a MIC90 of 0.5μg/mL. Significant differences on the MIC values were found among the 3 countries for several antimicrobials: compared with Germany, Belgium and Italy showed significantly higher MIC for lincomycin, spiramycin, and tylosin, and lower for oxytetracycline and florfenicol. The Belgian isolates showed the lowest MIC for enrofloxacin compared with Germany and Italy. The MIC results obtained in our study suggest the presence of a high level of resistance of M. bovis isolates originating from  milk to macrolides in all countries involved in this study. On the contrary, a low level of resistance was found against the antimicrobials that are not used in cattle, such as tiamulin and doxycycline, highlighting a possible link between antimicrobial treatments and development of resistance in the studied M. bovis population.

BACKGROUND: This study was aimed at evaluating the clinical protection, the level of Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) viremia and the immune response (antibodies and IFN-γ secreting cells (SC)) in piglets derived from PCV2 vaccinated sows and  themselves vaccinated against PCV2 at different age, namely at 4, 6 and 8 weeks.  The cohort study has been carried out over three subsequent production cycles (replicates). At the start/enrolment, 46 gilts were considered at first mating, bled and vaccinated. At the first, second and third farrowing, dams were bled and re-vaccinated at the subsequent mating after weaning piglets. Overall 400 piglets at each farrowing (first, second and third) were randomly allocated in three different groups (100 piglets/group) based on the timing of vaccination (4, 6 or  8 weeks of age). A fourth group was kept non-vaccinated (controls). Piglets were  vaccinated intramuscularly with one dose (2 mL) of a commercial PCV2a-based subunit vaccine (Porcilis® PCV). Twenty animals per group were bled at weaning and from vaccination to slaughter every 4 weeks for the detection of PCV2 viremia, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Clinical signs and individual treatments (morbidity), mortality, and body weight of all piglets were recorded. RESULTS: All vaccination schemes (4, 6 and 8 weeks of age) were able to induce an antibody response and IFN-γ SC. The highest clinical and virological protection sustained by immune reactivity was observed in pigs vaccinated at 6 weeks of age. Overall, repeated PCV2 vaccination in sows at mating and the subsequent higher levels of maternally derived antibodies did not significantly interfere with the  induction of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity in their piglets after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of vaccination in sows at mating and in piglets at 6 weeks of age was more effective for controlling PCV2 natural infection, than other vaccination schemas, thus sustaining that some interference of MDA with the induction of an efficient immune response could be considered. In conclusion, optimal vaccination strategy needs to balance the levels of passive immunity, the management practices and timing of infection.

Next-generation sequencing technology is now being increasingly applied to study  the within- and between-host population dynamics of viruses. However, information on avian influenza virus evolution and transmission during a naturally occurring  epidemic is still limited. Here, we use deep-sequencing data obtained from clinical samples collected from five industrial holdings and a backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 epidemic in Italy to unravel (i) the epidemic virus population diversity, (ii) the evolution of virus pathogenicity, and (iii) the pathways of viral transmission between different holdings and sheds. We show a high level of genetic diversity of the HPAI H7N7 viruses within a single farm as a consequence of separate bottlenecks and founder effects. In particular, we identified the cocirculation in the index case of two viral strains showing a different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine nucleotide differences at the consensus level and 92 minority variants. To assess interfarm transmission, we combined epidemiological and genetic data and identified the index case as the major source of the virus, suggesting the spread of different viral haplotypes from the index farm to the other industrial holdings, probably at different time  points. Our results revealed interfarm transmission dynamics that the epidemiological data alone could not unravel and demonstrated that delay in the disease detection and stamping out was the major cause of the emergence and the spread of the HPAI strain.IMPORTANCE: The within- and between-host evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain during a naturally  occurring epidemic is currently poorly understood. Here, we perform for the first time an in-depth sequence analysis of all the samples collected during a HPAI epidemic and demonstrate the importance to complement outbreak investigations with genetic data to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of the viruses and to  evaluate the within- and between-farm genetic diversity of the viral population.  We show that the evolutionary transition from the low pathogenic form to the highly pathogenic form occurred within the first infected flock, where we identified haplotypes with hemagglutinin cleavage site of different lengths. We also identify the index case as the major source of virus, indicating that prompt application of depopulation measures is essential to limit virus spread to other  farms.

BACKGROUND: In the last decades, Aedes albopictus has become an increasing public health threat in tropical as well as in more recently invaded temperate areas due to its capacity to transmit several human arboviruses, among which Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika. Enhancing the efficiency of currently used collection approaches, such as ovitraps and sticky traps, is desirable for optimal monitoring of the species abundance, for assessment of the risk of arbovirus transmission and for the optimisation of control activities. FINDINGS: Two sets of 4 × 4 Latin-square experiments were carried out in Tirana (Albania) to test whether modifications in ovitrap shape and size and in oviposition substrate would increase collections of Ae. albopictus eggs and whether hay-infusion would increase adult catches by sticky trap. Generalized Linear Mixed Models with negative binomial error distribution were carried out to analyse the data. Cylindrical ovitraps lined with germination paper yielded significantly higher egg catches than those exploiting either the (commonly used) wooden paddles or floating polystyrene blocks as oviposition substrates. No difference was observed between cylindrical and conical shaped ovitraps. Ovitraps and sticky traps baited with hay infusion yielded significantly higher egg and adult catches than un-baited ones. A significant relationship between ovitrap and sticky trap catches was observed both in the absence and in the presence of attractants, with ovitrap catches increasing more than sticky trap catches at increasing adult female densities. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides grounds for optimisation of ovitraps and sticky  traps as monitoring tools for Ae. albopictus by (i) supporting use of germination paper as most appropriate oviposition substrate; (ii) suggesting the possible use of stackable conical ovitraps for large scale monitoring; (iii) confirming the use of hay-infusion to increase egg catches in ovitraps, and showing that hay-infusion also significant increases adult catches by sticky traps.

Animal welfare during transportation has been investigated in several studies, as opposed to post-transportation phases. In this study, we evaluated the effect of  a novel environment after transportation on 26 Friesian bulls, 242 ± 42 day-old,  from ten different dairy farms. Animals were shipped to a breeding center in different seasons, and selected parameters of innate immunity (serum bactericidal activity, hemolytic complement, serum albumin, α, β, and γ-globulins, interleukin-6, TNF-α) were monitored before and after the arrival at days--4/0/4/15/30. Our results showed significant differences of IL-6 and TNF-α protein levels at destination in December (94 ± 1.3 pg/ml) and June (+788 pg/ml), respectively. Moreover, the serum levels of these cytokines increased between days 0 and 15 after the arrival, the modulation of IL-6 being in agreement with established models of physical and/or psychological stress. Concerning the modulation of albumin, alpha and beta-globulins, the highest levels were detected in April, whereas a significant decrease was observed between day 15 and 30 after arrival; on the contrary, γ-globulin levels significantly increased after day 15. The results of this study highlight the occurrence of innate immune responses of  young bulls to the combined effects of climate (season) and novel farming conditions.  Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is an important cause of acute food- borne zoonoses worldwide, typically carried by pigs. It is well known that Salmonella has evolved a wide array of strategies enabling it to invade the  host, but little information is available on the specific host responses to Salmonella infections. In the present study, we used an in vivo approach (involving piglets infected with a virulent or an attenuated S. Typhimurium strain) coupled to histological and proteomic analysis of the cecum mucosa, to highlight the host pathways activated during S. Typhimurium infection. We confirm the complex host-pathogen interaction. Our data showed that the metabolic and the cytoskeleton organization functions were the most significantly altered. In particular, the modifications of energy metabolic pathway could suggest a "nutriprive" mechanism, in which the host reduce its metabolic and energetic status to limit Salmonella infection. This study could represent a preliminary approach, providing information useful to better understand the host-Salmonella interaction.  Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The genus Vibrio includes several food-borne pathogens that cause a spectrum of clinical conditions including septicemia, cholera and milder forms of gastroenteritis. Several Vibrio spp. are commonly associated with food-borne transmission including Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus. Microbiological analysis for enumeration and isolation of Vibrio spp. were carried out for a total of 93 samples of seafood, meat and meat products from different geographic localities in Libya (Tripoli, Regdalin, Janzour and Tobruk). Vibrio spp. were detected by conventional cultural and molecular method  using PCR and sequencing of 16S rDNA. Out of the 93 cultured samples only 48 (51.6%) yielded colonies on Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salt agar (TCBS) with culture characteristics of Vibrio spp. More than half (n=27) of processed seafood samples (n=46) yielded colonies on TCBS, while only 44.6 % of samples of meat and meat products showed colonies on TCBS. Among cultured seafood samples, the highest bacterial count was recorded in clam with a count of 3.8 ×10(4) CFU\g. Chicken burger samples showed the highest bacterial count with 6.5 ×10(4) CFU\g.  Molecular analysis of the isolates obtained in this study, showed that 11 samples out of 48 (22.9%) were Vibrio spp. Vibrio parahemolyticus was isolated from camel meat for the first time. This study is an initial step to provide a baseline for  future molecular research targeting Vibrio spp. foodborne illnesses. This data will be used to provide information on the magnitude of such pathogens in Libyan  seafood, meat and meat products.   PMCID: PMC4791562	27004169

Consumption of milk and dairy products is considered one of the main routes of human exposure to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Quantitative data on MAP load in raw cows' milk are essential starting point for exposure assessment. Our study provides this information on a regional scale, estimating the load of MAP in bulk tank milk (BTM) produced in Emilia-Romagna region (Italy). The survey was carried out on 2934 BTM samples (88.6% of the farms herein present) using two different target sequences for qPCR (f57 and IS900). Data about the performances of both qPCRs are also reported, highlighting the superior sensitivity of IS900-qPCR. Seven hundred and eighty-nine samples tested  MAP-positive (apparent prevalence 26.9%) by IS900 qPCR. However, only 90 of these samples were quantifiable by qPCR. The quantifiable samples contained a median load of 32.4 MAP cells mL(-1) (and maximum load of 1424 MAP cells mL(-1) ). This  study has shown that a small proportion (3.1%) of BTM samples from Emilia-Romagna region contained MAP in excess of the limit of detection (1.5 × 10(1) MAP cells mL(-1) ), indicating low potential exposure for consumers if the milk subsequently undergoes pasteurization or if it is destined to typical hard cheese production.  © 2016 The Authors.

The complex life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii involves many animal species, raising zoonotic, economic, and conservation issues. This complexity is reflected in the  molecular structure of T. gondii, whose different genotypes differ in pathogenicity. Among the intermediate hosts of T. gondii, wild ungulates may be a source of human infection. Despite intense hunting activity and the consumption of raw or undercooked meat, little information is available on the spread of T. gondii and the distribution of its genotypes in these species, including the alpine chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra). Ninety-three sera and 50 brain tissues from chamois were sampled (1) to investigate the spread of T. gondii with serological and molecular analyses, and (2) to genotype the strains with a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the SAG2 locus. The prevalence of T. gondii was low on both serological (3.2 %) and molecular (2 %) analyses, and infections were concentrated in individuals >1 year old. These findings demonstrate the sporadic presence of the protozoan in this species on consistent diagnostic tests. Horizontal transmission seems to be the main route of infection, and cats are the only definitive host in the study area. This prevalence suggests that the environment of the chamois is less contaminated with oocysts than environments close to human settlements. The SAG2 type II genotype was detected in this species for the first time. Although this genotype is predominant in human toxoplasmosis, these results suggest that the chamois is a minor source of human infection.  DOI: 10.1007/s00436-016-4981-x 	26960960

BACKGROUND: Foodborne Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) outbreaks are being recognized as an emerging public health problem in industrialized countries. In 2013 three foodborne HAV outbreaks occurred in Europe and one in USA. During the largest of  the three European outbreaks, most cases occurred in Italy (>1,200 cases as of March 31, 2014). A national Task Force was established at the beginning of the outbreak by the Ministry of Health. Mixed frozen berries were early demonstrated  to be the source of infection by the identity of viral sequences in patients and  in food. In the present study the molecular characterization of HAV isolates from 355 Italian cases is reported. METHODS: Molecular characterization was carried out by PCR/sequencing (VP1/2A region), comparison with reference strains and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: A unique strain was responsible for most characterized cases (235/355, 66.1%). Molecular data had a key role in tracing this outbreak, allowing 110 out  of the 235 outbreak cases (46.8%) to be recognized in absence of any other link.  The data also showed background circulation of further unrelated strains, both autochthonous and travel related, whose sequence comparison highlighted minor outbreaks and small clusters, most of them unrecognized on the basis of epidemiological data. Phylogenetic analysis showed most isolates from travel related cases clustering with reference strains originating from the same geographical area of travel. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the study documents, in a real outbreak context, the  crucial role of molecular analysis in investigating an old but re-emerging pathogen. Improving the molecular knowledge of HAV strains, both autochthonous and circulating in countries from which potentially contaminated foods are imported, will become increasingly important to control outbreaks by supporting trace back activities, aiming to identify the geographical source(s) of contaminated food, as well as public health interventions.

Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory  disease of chickens caused by an alphaherpesvirus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). Recently, full genome sequences of wild-type and vaccine strains have been determined worldwide, but none was from Europe. The aim of this study was to determine and analyse the complete genome sequences of five ILTV strains.  Sequences were also compared to reveal the similarity of strains across time and  to discriminate between wild-type and vaccine strains. Genomes of three ILTV field isolates from outbreaks occurred in Italy in 1980, 2007 and 2011, and two commercial chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines were sequenced using the 454 Life Sciences technology. The comparison with the Serva genome showed that 35 open reading frames (ORFs) differed across the five genomes. Overall, 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 27 amino acid differences in 19 ORFs and two  insertions in the UL52 and ORFC genes were identified. Similarity among the field strains and between the field and the vaccine strains ranged from 99.96% to 99.99%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship among them, as well.  This study generated data on genomic variation among Italian ILTV strains revealing that, even though the genetic variability of the genome is well conserved across time and between wild-type and vaccine strains, some mutations may help in differentiating among them and may be involved in ILTV virulence/attenuation. The results of this study can contribute to the understanding of the molecular bases of ILTV pathogenicity and provide genetic markers to differentiate between wild-type and vaccine strains.

The recent identification in rabbits of hepatitis E viruses (HEV) related to viruses infecting humans raises the question of the role of this species as possible HEV reservoir. A serological survey on rabbit HEV infection was conducted in Italy during 2013-2014, including both farmed and pet rabbits. We found an anti-HEV antibody seroprevalence of 3.40 % in 206 farmed rabbits (collected on 7 farms) and 6.56 % in 122 pets. RNA was extracted from IgG-positive sera and analyzed by HEV-specific real-time RT-PCR. None of the samples were positive, confirming that no viremia was present in the presence of  IgG. Only one serum sample from a farmed rabbit was positive for IgM, but no HEV  RNA was detected in it. Pet rabbit feces were also tested for HEV RNA, with negative results. This finding suggests that HEV is circulating in rabbits in Italy.  DOI: 10.1007/s00705-016-2778-y 	26873813

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of transport-related stress  on the liver gene expression of four acute phase proteins (APP), namely α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and PIT54, in turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). A group of seven BUT BIG 6 commercial hens was subjected to a two-hour long road transportation and the quantitative gene expression of APP in the liver was compared to that of a non transported control  group. The expression of AGP and CRP mRNA was found to be increased in animals slaughtered after road transport. The presence of AGP protein was also confirmed  by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The results of this study showed that road-transport may induce the mRNA expression of immune related proteins. The finding that AGP and CRP can be upregulated during transport could suggest their use as for the assessment of turkey welfare during transport.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an important zoonotic gastrointestinal pathogen responsible for foodborne disease worldwide. It is a successful enteric  pathogen because it has developed virulence strategies allowing it to survive in  a highly inflamed intestinal environment exploiting inflammation to overcome colonization resistance provided by intestinal microbiota. In this study, we used piglets featuring an intact microbiota, which naturally develop gastroenteritis,  as model for salmonellosis. We compared the effects on the intestinal microbiota  induced by a wild type and an attenuated S. Typhimurium in order to evaluate whether the modifications are correlated with the virulence of the strain. This study showed that Salmonella alters microbiota in a virulence-dependent manner. We found that the wild type S. Typhimurium induced inflammation and a reduction of specific protecting microbiota species (SCFA-producing bacteria) normally involved in providing a barrier against pathogens. Both these effects could contribute to impair colonization resistance, increasing the host susceptibility  to wild type S. Typhimurium colonization. In contrast, the attenuated S. Typhimurium, which is characterized by a reduced ability to colonize the intestine, and by a very mild inflammatory response, was unable to successfully sustain competition with the microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a common risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Currently, there are no specific treatments against NAFLD. Thus, examining any molecule with potential benefits against this condition emerged melatonin as a molecule that influences metabolic dysfunctions. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin would function against NAFDL, studying morphological, ultrastuctural and metabolic markers that characterize the liver of ob/ob mice. METHODS: Lean and ob/ob mice were supplemented with melatonin in the drinking water for 8 weeks. Histology and stereology were performed to assess hepatic steatosis and glycogen deposition. Ultrastructural features of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and their juxtapositions were evaluated in livers of all experimental groups. Furthermore, hepatic distribution and expression of markers of ER and mitochondria (calnexin, ATP sintase β, GRP78 and CHOP) and metabolic dysfunction (RPB4, β-catenin) and cellular longevity (SIRT1) were analyzed. RESULTS: Melatonin significantly reduced glycemia, identified also by a decrease  of hepatic RBP4 expression, reversed macrosteatosis in microsteatosis at the hepatic pericentral zone, enlarged ER-mitochondrial distance and ameliorated the  morphology and organization of these organelles in ob/ob mouse liver. Furthermore, in ob/ob mice, calnexin and ATP synthase β were partially restored,  GRP78 and CHOP decreased in periportal and midzonal hepatocytes and β-catenin expression was, in part, restored in peripheral membranes of hepatocytes. Melatonin supplementation to ob/ob mice improves hepatic morphological, ultrastructural and metabolic damage that occurs as a result of NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin may be a potential adjuvant treatment to limit NAFLD and its progression into irreversible complications.  DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0148115  PMCID: PMC4732686	26824477

Electronic address: paolo.moroni@unimi.it.  The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has recently frequently been reported in dairy cattle, usually with low prevalence. The livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) ST398 is especially involved in cases of subclinical and clinical mastitis. Swine carry LA-MRSA without clinical symptoms  and are considered its reservoir and shedder. People exposed to swine are particularly at risk of LA-MRSA colonization. Environments with relevant livestock density are a demonstrated risk factor for humans to be carriers of a LA-MRSA. This work investigated dairy farms located in an area with a high livestock density, mainly represented by swine. Bulk tank milk samples from 224 dairy farms were collected, and their status was defined as MRSA-positive or MRSA-negative based on culture on chromogenic medium. The number of fattening swine and of fattening swine herds was calculated in an area of 3 km around each  dairy farm through georeferencing. The probability of a Staphylococcus aureus-positive dairy farm to be MRSA positive based on the extent of potential infective pressure due to swine density was calculated. Both the number of swine  herds and the number of swine were associated with the MRSA status of dairy herds. The 9 MRSA isolated were typed by multi-locus sequence typing and spa-typing, and characterized for their virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance profiles. The ST and spa-types detected are consistent with those present in the Italian swine population. Virulence and resistance profiles are mostly consistent with the types detected. This work provides the first evidence  of the epidemiological challenge exerted by the density of the swine population on MRSA in dairy cows.  Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

In this context, classic Enzyme linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) remains the most common analytical platform employed  for serological analyses. The analysis of pooled samples instead of individual ones is a common procedure that permits to certify, with one single test, entire  herds as "disease-free". However, diagnostic tests for pooled samples need to be  particularly sensitive, especially when the levels of disease markers are low, as in the case of anti-BoHV1 antibodies in milk as markers of Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) disease. The avidin-nucleic-acid-nanoassembly (ANANAS) is a novel kind of signal amplification platform for immunodiagnostics based on colloidal poly-avidin nanoparticles that, using model analytes, was shown to strongly increase ELISA test performance as compared to monomeric avidin. Here, for the first time, we applied the ANANAS reagent integration in a real diagnostic context. The monoclonal 1G10 anti-bovine IgG1 antibody was biotinylated and integrated with the ANANAS reagents for indirect IBR diagnosis from pooled milk mimicking tank samples from herds with IBR prevalence between 1  to 8%. The sensitivity and specificity of the ANANAS integrated method was compared to that of a classic test based on the same 1G10 antibody directly linked to horseradish peroxidase, and a commercial IDEXX kit recently introduced  in the market. ANANAS integration increased by 5-fold the sensitivity of the 1G10 mAb-based conventional ELISA without loosing specificity. When compared to the commercial kit, the 1G10-ANANAS integrated method was capable to detect the presence of anti-BHV1 antibodies from bulk milk of gE antibody positive animals with 2-fold higher sensitivity and similar specificity. The results demonstrate the potentials of this new amplification technology, which permits improving current classic ELISA sensitivity limits without the need for new hardware investments.

A multiclass method for screening and confirmatory analysis of antimicrobial residues in muscle has been developed and validated, according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Sixty-two antibiotics belonging to ten different drug families (amphenicols, beta-lactams, diamino-pyrimidine, lincosamides, macrolides, pleuromutilins, quinolones, rifamycins, sulfonamides and tetracyclines) have been included in the method. After the addition of an aqueous solution of EDTA, the minced muscle was extracted with acetonitrile/water mixture and, later, with pure acetonitrile. The extract was evaporated and redissolved in ammonium acetate buffer prior to LC injection. Instrumental determination was performed by liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid high resolution mass analyser (LC-HRMS/MS) operating in positive electrospray ionization mode. Chromatographic separation was optimized on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (100 ×  3.0 mm, 2.7 μm) with gradient using methanol and water containing 0.1% of formic  acid as mobile phases. The method was validated in bovine muscle in the range 3.3-150 μg kg(-1) for all antibiotics; for some compounds with MRL higher than 100 μg kg(-1), the validation interval has been extended until 1500 μg kg(-1). The studied performance characteristics were selectivity, linearity, precision, trueness (recovery), decision limits, detection capabilities, detection and quantification limits. Satisfactory quantitative performances were obtained for all the analytes. Ruggedness tests demonstrated the applicability to swine and poultry muscle, too. Finally the wide participation in proficiency tests allowed  to investigate in deep the method performances.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We report the spread of a clone of multidrug-resistant (MDR), ESBL-producing (blaCTX-M-1) Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis, in the Italian broiler chicken industry and along the food-chain. This was first detected in Italy in 2011 and led to human infection in Italy in 2013-2014.A set (n = 49) of  extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant (R) isolates of S. Infantis (2011-2014) from humans, food-producing animals and meat thereof, were studied along with a selected set of earlier and more recent ESC-susceptible (ESC-S) isolates (n = 42, 2001-2014). They were characterized by macrorestriction-PFGE analysis and genetic environment of ESC-resistance. Isolates representative of PFGE-patterns and origin were submitted to Whole Genome Sequencing. The emerging  ESC-R clone, detected mainly from broiler chickens, broiler meat and humans, showed a minimum pattern of clinical resistance to cefotaxime, tetracycline, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim, beside ciprofloxacin microbiological resistance (MIC 0.25 mg/L). All isolates of this clone harbored a conjugative megaplasmid (~ 280-320 Kb), similar to that described in ESC-susceptible S. Infantis in Israel (pESI-like) in 2014. This megaplasmid carried the ESBL gene blaCTX-M-1, and additional genes [tet(A), sul1, dfrA1 and dfrA14] mediating cefotaxime, tetracycline, sulfonamide, and trimethoprim resistance. It also contained genes conferring enhanced colonization capability, virulence (fimbriae, yersiniabactin), resistance and fitness (qacE1, mer) in the intensive-farming environment. This emerging clone of S. Infantis has been causing infections in humans, most likely through the broiler industry. Since S. Infantis is among major serovars causing human infections in Europe and is an emerging non-typhoidal Salmonella globally, further spread of this lineage in primary productions deserves quick and thorough risk-management strategies.

Our study describes a newly developed mini-array test for the rapid detection of  poxviruses in animals and humans. The method is based on detection that combines  target nucleic acid amplification by polymerase chain reaction and specific hybridization, using enzyme-linked antibodies, allowing identification of zoonotic orthopoxviruses and parapoxviruses in animal and human biological samples. With 100% specificity, the test rules out the possibility of cross-reactions with viral agents causing look-alike diseases. The assay was employed in the field to investigate the causes of several outbreaks of a malignant proliferative skin disease that affected domestic ruminants in Sicily during 2011-2014. Due to specific aspects of the lesions, the animals were clinically diagnosed with papillomatosis. The mini-array test allowed the identification of coinfections caused by more than 1 viral species belonging to the Parapoxvirus and Orthopoxvirus genera, either in goats or in cattle. Our study suggests that the so-called "papillomatosis" can be the result of multiple  infections with epitheliotropic viruses, including zoonotic poxviruses that cannot be properly identified with classical diagnostic techniques.  © 2015 The Author(s).

Traditionally, embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) are considered the gold standard for Influenza virus isolation and vaccine production. Nowadays, different biological systems have been improved and performed, in order to evaluate a feasible alternative to ECE. In fact, in a previous study, mammalian and avian cell cultures were successfully used for avian influenza viruses primary isolation from target tissues and virus propagation. This research is focused on  the investigation of adaptive mutations that occur after influenza A virus amplification in ECE and cell cultures. The results of the study shows that avian influenza viruses after multiple passages in different biological systems undergo mutations, in particular, the largest number of amino acid substitutions occurred in all biological substrates in the hemagglutinin.

BACKGROUND: The aims of this field trial were to describe the clinical-pathologic findings in calves with otitis media (OM) and media-interna (OMI), to evaluate, through the development of a scoring system, the effectiveness of a standardized  therapeutic protocol, and to identify the causative pathogens and their possible  correlation with concurrent respiratory disease. All animals underwent physical and neurological examinations at three experimental time points: at diagnosis/beginning of treatment (T0), 1 week (T1) and 2 weeks (T2) after therapy was started, respectively. Follow-up telephone interviews with animal owners were conducted 1 month later. The therapeutic protocol consisted of tulathromycin (Draxxin®; Zoetis), oxytetracycline hydrochloride (Terramicina 100®; Zoetis), and carprofen (Rimadyl®; Zoetis). RESULTS: Twenty-two calves were enrolled. Physical and otoscopic examination at T0 revealed monolateral and bilateral otorrhea in 16 and 6 calves, respectively,  with peripheral vestibular system involvement in calves presenting with neurological signs (n = 17; 77 %). A significant improvement of clinical and neurological scores was observed in 20 (90 %) calves, a full recovery in only 1 (5 %). One calf worsened between T0 and T1 and it was removed from the study. None of the other animals showed a worsening of clinical conditions and/or required further treatments at one month follow up. Mycoplasma bovis was isolated in 89 % of the affected ears either alone or together with P. multocida (n = 5),  Streptococcus spp. (n = 1), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 1), and Pseudomonas spp. (n  = 1). M. bovis either alone or together with these bacteria was also isolated from the upper and/or lower respiratory tract in 19 (86 %) calves. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized therapeutic protocol for the treatment of OM/OMI in calves. The therapy led to clinical improvement in the majority of the calves. Persistence of mild clinical-neurological signs did not compromise productive performance. The numerical scoring system for clinical and neurological signs permitted objective  evaluation of response to therapy. M. bovis was the pathogen most often isolated. This finding should be considered in the treatment of OM/OMI in calves. Moreover, respiratory tract infection should not be underrated, since it is one of the major risk factors for the development of OM/OMI.  DOI: 10.1186/s12917-015-0606-3  PMCID: PMC4669636	26634824

BACKGROUND: The invasive species Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus was first identified in north-eastern Italy in 2011, during the ongoing surveillance activity of Aedes albopictus. Following this finding, a more intensive monitoring was carried out to assess the distribution of the species and to collect biological data. Herein, we report the new records obtained by four years of surveillance. FINDINGS: The presence of Ae. koreicus was checked using ovitraps, adults traps and by larval collections in all possible breeding sites from May 2011 to July 2015. The monitoring started in the site of the first detection (Province of Belluno) and was then extended in the neighbouring Provinces belonging to four Regions. Aedes koreicus was found in 73 municipalities out of 155 monitored (47.1 %), including 23 municipalities (14.8 %) previously not infested. The area of first detection of Ae. koreicus (Province of Belluno) was also the most infested  (68 %). However the mosquito has also been found to the west (Province of Trento) and to the south and south-west (Provinces of Vicenza and Treviso) of the initially infested area. CONCLUSIONS: The spread of Ae. koreicus is directed towards south and west from the original infested area, likely due to the dense road connections and the habitat suitability of the new areas. According to these records, northern Italy  has a high probability to be invaded by Ae. koreicus in the next decade. These data can be useful to validate predictive models of potential distribution and dispersal of this species in Italy or in Europe.  DOI: 10.1186/s13071-015-1208-4  PMCID: PMC4666031	26626019

Baumann J(1), Kouassi NM(1), Foni E(2), Klenk HD(1), Matrosovich M(3).  Author information:  (1)Institute of Virology, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany. (2)OIE Reference Laboratory for Swine Influenza, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia ed Emilia Romagna, Parma, Italy. (3)Institute of Virology, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany m.matrosovich@gmail.com.  The H1N1 Eurasian avian-like swine (EAsw) influenza viruses originated from an avian H1N1 virus. To characterize potential changes in the membrane fusion activity of the hemagglutinin (HA) during avian-to-swine adaptation of the virus, we studied EAsw viruses isolated in the first years of their circulation in pigs  and closely related contemporary H1N1 viruses of wild aquatic birds. Compared to  the avian viruses, the swine viruses were less sensitive to neutralization by lysosomotropic agent NH4Cl in MDCK cells, had a higher pH optimum of hemolytic activity, and were less stable at acidic pH. Eight amino acid substitutions in the HA were found to separate the EAsw viruses from their putative avian precursor; four substitutions-T492S, N722D, R752K, and S1132F-were located in the structural regions of the HA2 subunit known to play a role in acid-induced conformational transition of the HA. We also studied low-pH-induced syncytium formation by cell-expressed HA proteins and found that the HAs of the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 pandemic viruses required a lower pH for fusion induction than did the HA of a representative EAsw virus. Our data show that transmission of an avian H1N1 virus to pigs was accompanied by changes in conformational stability and fusion promotion activity of the HA. We conclude that distinctive host-determined fusion characteristics of the HA may represent a barrier for avian-to-swine and swine-to-human transmission of influenza viruses.IMPORTANCE: Continuing cases of human infections with zoonotic influenza viruses highlight the necessity to understand which viral properties contribute to interspecies transmission. Efficient binding of the HA to cellular receptors in a new host species is known to be essential for the transmission. Less is known about required adaptive changes in the membrane fusion activity of the HA. Here we show that adaptation of an avian influenza virus to pigs in Europe in 1980s was accompanied by mutations in the HA, which decreased its conformational stability  and increased pH optimum of membrane fusion activity. This finding represents the first formal evidence of alteration of the HA fusion activity/stability during interspecies transmission of influenza viruses under natural settings.

In 2013-2014, 201 pigs belonging to 67 batches were tested for Salmonella in their mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) in one abattoir of Northern Italy. For each batch, faecal material was collected at lairage by swabbing the pen floor for approximately 1600 cm(2). The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella in MLN of pigs at slaughter, to assess Salmonella contamination at  lairage and to evaluate the effect of lairage duration on its prevalence. Serotyping, XbaI PFGE typing and antimicrobial testing of the isolates were performed. Pig and human Salmonella isolates of the same region of Italy were compared to evaluate possible correlations. Salmonella enterica was isolated from 19.9% of the MLN and 49.3% of the environmental faecal samples. Nine different serovars were identified among 75 S. enterica isolates. In MLN Salmonella Derby was the most common (52.5%), followed by S. enterica 4,[5],12:i:- (17.5%) and Salmonella Rissen (10.0%). In faecal samples S. Derby was prevalent (51.4%), followed by S. enterica 4,[5], 12:i:- (20.0%) and Salmonella Brandenburg (14.3%). Lairage holding varied between 1 and ≥ 12 h (median value: 2.5h). In pigs held for 1-3h, 14.1% were positive for Salmonella in MLN but the prevalence reached 31.8% when they were held for ≥ 12 h. The contamination of MLN was statistically  different (p=0.0045) between the two groups, thus confirming the role of long-lasting lairage in Salmonella contamination of pigs. XbaI PFGE typing detected 36 PFGE types. Twenty-three PFGE types were identified among the 40 MLN  isolates and 22 PFGE types among the 35 faecal isolates. A total of 11 PFGE types were shared between the MLN of pigs and the lairage environment. Among S. Derby,  6 shared PFGE types between MLN and faeces were found and among S. enterica 4,[5],12:i:- one PFGE type was common between MLN and the faecal samples. Shared  profiles between human and swine isolates of S. Derby, S. enterica 4,[5],12:i:-,  S. Rissen, Salmonella Manhattan, S. Brandenburg, Salmonella Livingstone, Salmonella London and Salmonella Muenchen were identified. Among S. Derby and S.  enterica 4,[5],12:i:- isolates found in pigs, 6/15 profiles (40.0%) and 8/10 (80.0%) were shared with human isolates. High resistance rates to streptomycin (97.3%), sulphonamide compounds (84.0%) and tetracycline (56.0%) were observed. No resistance was detected to ertapenem and meropenem. High proportions of isolates showed intermediate sensitivity to ciprofloxacin (85.3%) and cefotaxime  (66.7%). High sensitivity rates were found to chloramphenicol (96.0%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (81.3%).  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electronic address: hansulrich.graber@agroscope.admin.ch.  Staphylococcus aureus is globally one of the most important pathogens causing contagious mastitis in cattle. Previous studies using ribosomal spacer (RS)-PCR,  however, demonstrated in Swiss cows that Staph. aureus isolated from bovine intramammary infections are genetically heterogeneous, with Staph. aureus genotype B (GTB) and GTC being the most prominent genotypes. Furthermore, Staph.  aureus GTB was found to be contagious, whereas Staph. aureus GTC and all the remaining genotypes were involved in individual cow disease. In addition to RS-PCR, other methods for subtyping Staph. aureus are known, including spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). They are based on sequencing the spa and various housekeeping genes, respectively. The aim of the present study was to compare the 3 analytic methods using 456 strains of Staph. aureus isolated from milk of bovine intramammary infections and bulk tanks obtained from 12 European countries. Furthermore, the phylogeny of animal Staph. aureus was inferred and the zoonotic transfer of Staph. aureus between cattle and humans was studied. The analyzed strains could be grouped into 6 genotypic clusters, with CLB, CLC, and CLR being the most prominent ones. Comparing the 3 subtyping methods, RS-PCR showed the highest resolution, followed by spa typing and MLST. We found associations among the methods but in many cases they were unsatisfactory except  for CLB and CLC. Cluster CLB was positive for clonal complex (CC)8 in 99% of the  cases and typically positive for t2953; it is the cattle-adapted form of CC8. Cluster CLC was always positive for tbl 2645 and typically positive for CC705. For CLR and the remaining subtypes, links among the 3 methods were generally poor. Bovine Staph. aureus is highly clonal and a few clones predominate. Animal  Staph. aureus always evolve from human strains, such that every human strain may  be the ancestor of a novel animal-adapted strain. The zoonotic transfer of IMI- and milk-associated strains of Staph. aureus between cattle and humans seems to be very limited and different hosts are not considered as a source for mutual, spontaneous infections. Spillover events, however, may happen.  Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.3168/jds.2015-9589 	26601578

Honey, in particular monofloral varieties, is a valuable commodity. Here, we present proton transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometry, PTR-ToF-MS, coupled to chemometrics as a successful tool in the classification of monofloral  honeys, which should serve in fraud protection against mispresentation of the floral origin of honey. We analyzed 7 different honey varieties from citrus, chestnut, sunflower, honeydew, robinia, rhododendron and linden tree, in total 70 different honey samples and a total of 206 measurements. Only subtle differences  in the profiles of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the headspace of the  different honeys could be found. Nevertheless, it was possible to successfully apply 6 different classification methods with a total correct assignment of 81-99% in the internal validation sets. The most successful methods were stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and probabilistic neural network (PNN), giving total correct assignments in the external validation sets of 100 and 90%, respectively. Clearly, PTR-ToF-MS/chemometrics is a powerful tool in honey classification.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.talanta.2015.09.062 	26592598

The quantitative and qualitative patterns of environmental contamination by Listeria monocytogenes were investigated in the production chain of dry-cured Parma ham. Standard arrays of surfaces were sampled in processing facilities during a single visit per plant in the three compartments of the food chain, i.e., ham production (19 plants) and postproduction, which was divided into deboning (43 plants) and slicing (25 plants) steps. The numbers of sampled surfaces were 384 in ham production, with 25 positive for L. monocytogenes, and 1,084 in postproduction, with 83 positives. Statistical analysis of the prevalence of contaminated surfaces showed that in ham production, contamination  was higher at the beginning of processing and declined significantly toward the end, while in postproduction, prevalence rose toward the end of processing. Prevalence was higher in the deboning facilities than in slicing facilities and was dependent on the type of surface (floor/drainage > clothing > equipment). The qualitative pattern of contamination was investigated through an analysis of the  survey isolates and a set of isolates derived from routine monitoring, including  longitudinal isolations. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed a remarkable clonality of  L. monocytogenes within plants, with the detection of 16 plant-specific clones out of 17 establishments with multiple isolates. Repeated detections of clonal isolates >6 months apart were also observed. Six was the maximum number of between-isolate differences in core SNPs observed within these clones. Based on the same six-SNP threshold, three clusters of clonal isolates, shared by six establishments, were also identified. The spread of L. monocytogenes within and between plants, as indicated by its clonal behavior, is a matter of concern for the hygienic management of establishments.

Previous studies, however, have demonstrated in Swiss cows that Staph. aureus isolated from bovine intramammary infection is genetically heterogeneous, with Staph. aureus genotype B (GTB) and GTC being the  most prominent genotypes. In addition, Staph. aureus GTB was found to be contagious, whereas Staph. aureus GTC and all the remaining genotypes were involved in individual cow disease. The aim of this study was to subtype strains  of Staph. aureus isolated from bovine mastitic milk and bulk tank milk to obtain  a unified view of the presence of bovine staphylococcal subtypes in 12 European countries. A total of 456 strains of Staph. aureus were subjected to different typing methods: ribosomal spacer PCR, detection of enterotoxin genes, and detection of gene polymorphisms (lukE, coa). Major genotypes with their variants  were combined into genotypic clusters (CL). This study revealed 5 major CL representing 76% of all strains and comprised CLB, CLC, CLF, CLI, and CLR. The clusters were characterized by the same genetic properties as the Swiss isolates, demonstrating high clonality of bovine Staph. aureus. Interestingly, CLB was situated in central Europe whereas the other CL were widely disseminated. The remaining 24% of the strains comprised 41 genotypes and variants, some of which (GTAM, GTBG) were restricted to certain countries; many others, however, were observed only once.

Erratum in     PLoS One. 2015;10(12):e0146436.  West Nile virus (WNV) is a recently re-emerged health problem in Europe. In Italy, an increasing number of outbreaks of West Nile disease, with occurrences of human cases, have been reported since 2008. This is particularly true in northern Italy, where entomological surveillance systems have been implemented at a regional level. The aim of this study was to use, for the first time, all the entomological data collected in the five regions undergoing surveillance for WNV  in northern Italy to characterize the viral circulation (at a spatial and temporal scale), identify potential mosquito vectors, and specify relationships between virus circulation and meteorological conditions. In 2013, 286 sites covering the entire Pianura Padana area were monitored. A total of 757,461 mosquitoes were sampled. Of these, 562,079 were tested by real-time PCR in 9,268  pools, of which 180 (1.9%) were positive for WNV. The largest part of the detected WNV sequences belonged to lineage II, demonstrating that, unlike those in the past, the 2013 outbreak was mainly sustained by this WNV lineage. This surveillance also detected the Usutu virus, a WNV-related flavivirus, in 241 (2.6%) pools. The WNV surveillance systems precisely identified the area affected by the virus and detected the viral circulation approximately two weeks before the occurrence of onset of human cases. Ninety percent of the sampled mosquitoes  were Culex pipiens, and 178/180 WNV-positive pools were composed of only this species, suggesting this mosquito is the main WNV vector in northern Italy. A significantly higher abundance of the vector was recorded in the WNV circulation  area, which was characterized by warmer and less rainy conditions and greater evapotranspiration compared to the rest of the Pianura Padana, suggesting that areas exposed to these conditions are more suitable for WNV circulation. This observation highlights warmer and less rainy conditions as factors able to enhance WNV circulation and cause virus spillover outside the sylvatic cycle.

The method is based on a solid-liquid extraction and a dilute-and-shoot approach. Accuracy and precision were established at the LOQ (1 μg kg(-1)); the mean overall recovery (n = 6) was 98%, with a confidence interval of 3.8% and a CV% of 3.7%. Accuracy and precision were also assessed at three other concentration levels (2.03, 5.07 and 10.14 μg kg(-1); six replicates per level).  The mean overall recovery (n = 24, LOQ included) was 99% with a confidence interval of 0.8% and a CV% of 1.9%. The method was then applied to 14 naturally incurred feed samples. Aflatoxin B1 was present in the range 28.7-240.1 µg kg(-1), while lower concentrations of sterigmatocystin were found (0.7-2.2 µg kg(-1)). This method may represent a valuable choice, ensuring a high level of accuracy and precision, as well as high-throughput performance. Therefore, it meets the recent EFSA opinion recommendation in terms of availability of fast and sensitive methods (recommended LOQ = 1.5 μg kg(-1)) in order to increase data collection to allow for the assessment of dietary exposure.

The 129 mouse strain is commonly used for the generation of genetically engineered mice. Genetic drift or accidental contamination during outcrossing has resulted in several 129 substrains. Comprehensive data on spontaneous age-related pathology exist for the 129S4/SvJae substrain, whereas only limited information is available for other 129 substrains. This longitudinal aging study describes the life span and spontaneous lesions of 44 male and 18 female mice of the 129S6/SvEvTac substrain. Median survival time was 778 and 770 days for males and  females, respectively. Tumors of lung and Harderian gland were the most common neoplasms in both sexes. Hepatocellular tumors occurred mainly in males. Hematopoietic tumors were observed at low frequency. Suppurative and ulcerative blepharoconjunctivitis was the most common nonneoplastic condition in both sexes. Corynebacteria (primarily Corynebacterium urealyticum and C. pseudodiphtheriticum) were isolated from animals with blepharoconjunctivitis and  in some cases from unaffected mice, although a clear causal association between corynebacterial infections and blepharoconjunctivitis could not be inferred. Polyarteritis occurred only in males and was identified as the most common nonneoplastic contributory cause of death. Eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia occurred in both sexes and was a relevant cause of death or comorbidity. Epithelial hyalinosis at extrapulmonary sites was noted at higher frequency in females. This study contributes important data on the spontaneous age-related pathology of the 129S6/SvEvTac mouse substrain and is a valuable reference for evaluation of the phenotype in genetically engineered mice obtained with this 129 substrain.  © The Author(s) 2015.

Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in the host's immune response and other homeostatic control actions. Three IFN types and several IFN families within the  types allow for a plethora of regulatory actions. The number of distinct IFN molecules is highest among type I IFNs and, in particular, within the IFN-α family. In pigs, there are 17 IFN-α subtypes with different antiviral activities  and different expression profiles; however, no data are available about biological properties other than the antiviral effector activities. Therefore, 16 porcine IFN-α genes were cloned, expressed in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells, and characterized for antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and MHC-modulating activities at a pre-established level of 10 IU/mL. Antiviral activity: IFN-α2, -α5, -α9, and -α10 showed the highest level of activity in a pseudorabies virus yield reduction assay. On the contrary, little, if any, activity was shown by IFN-α3, -α7, -α13, -α4, and -α15. Anti-inflammatory activity: With the exception  of IFNs-α2, -α7, -α9, and -α11, all IFN-α subtypes had significant anti-inflammatory control activity in an interleukin-8 (IL-8) yield reduction assay. Gene expression analyses showed that some IFN-α subtypes can significantly downregulate the expression of IL-8, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-6, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), βD1, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) genes, while maintaining or upregulating the expression of βD4. Immunomodulation: A significant upregulation of class I and/or class II MHC was induced by all the IFNs under study, with the exception of IFNs-α11, -α15, and -α16, which instead significantly downregulated class I MHC. Our results indicate that gene duplications in the porcine IFN-α family underlie diverse effector and regulatory activities, being therefore instrumental in host survival and environmental adaptation. This role of IFN-α could be founded on fine-tuning and regulation of  pro- and anti-inflammatory control actions after exposure to both infectious and  noninfectious environmental stressors.

Typhimurium) is responsible for foodborne zoonotic infections that, in humans, induce self-limiting gastroenteritis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the wild-type strain S. Typhimurium (STM14028) is able to exploit inflammation fostering an active infection. Due to the similarity between human and porcine diseases induced by S. Typhimurium, we used piglets as  a model for salmonellosis and gastrointestinal research. This study showed that STM14028 is able to efficiently colonize in vitro porcine mono-macrophages and intestinal columnar epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, and that the colonization significantly increases with LPS pre-treatment. This increase was then reversed by inhibiting the LPS stimulation through LPS antagonist, confirming an active role of LPS stimulation in STM14028-intracellular colonization. Moreover, LPS in  vivo treatment increased cytokines blood level and body temperature at 4 h post infection, which is consistent with an acute inflammatory stimulus, capable to influence the colonization of STM14028 in different organs and tissues. The present study proves for the first time that in acute enteric salmonellosis, S. Typhimurium exploits inflammation for its benefit in piglets.

A disease prediction system was investigated in a case-control study in the dry period of high-yielding dairy cows. Blood samples of 75 cows from 26 herds were collected before calving between -23 and -33 days (T1) and also between -2 and -6 days (T2) to investigate a panel of clinical immunology and chemistry parameters. Cows with abnormal serum lysozyme and interleukin-6 concentrations showed a greater disease prevalence until the 60th day in milk compared with non-responder cows (P<0.05 and lower at T1). Differences in disease prevalence were observed on the basis of T1 data, and also by combining the results at T1 and T2. The other laboratory parameters under study were not predictive of a disease risk. Results  indicate that environmental stressors in the dry period may cause a negative imprinting of the innate immune response, underlying predisposition to later disease occurrence.

In contrast to the depth of knowledge on the pathological effects of parasitism in domestic animals, the impact of the vast majority of parasites on wildlife hosts is poorly understood and, besides, information from domestics is rarely usable to disclose the parasites' impact on free-ranging populations' dynamics. Here we use Toxoplasmosis as a study model since, until now, the infection process and the protozoan's effects in natural conditions has received little attention. We analysed 81 sera from red deer (Cervus elaphus) sampled in Italian  Alps and through generalized linear models we evaluated (1) the epidemiological factors influencing T. gondii infection dynamics; (2) its impact on female fertility [corrected]. High seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was recorded in yearling (1 year-old; prevalence = 52.4%) and adult (>2 year-old; prevalence = 51.3%) red deer, while calves (<1 year-old) did not contract the infection suggesting horizontal transmission as the main route of infection. The stable prevalence between yearlings and adults and the higher serological titres of younger individuals lead to two alternative infection processes suggesting a difference between age classes or in acquiring the infection or in responding to  the pathogen. No associations between T. gondii serological titres and pregnancy  status was observed indicating no direct effect on the probability of being pregnant; nevertheless a relation between females' higher serological titres and  lower foetal development emerged, suggesting potential effects of the parasite infection on deer reproduction. The results demonstrate high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in free-ranging red deer and, furthermore, the effect on foetal  development suggests the potential impact of the parasite on red deer fertility and thus on its population dynamics.

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is associated with a number of diseases and syndromes, collectively referred to as porcine circovirus-associated disease. The main objective of this study was to define some in vitro correlates of protection after injection of inactivated PCV2 vaccines with a defined antigen mass. Twelve  pigs were vaccinated with three different doses of inactivated, whole-virus antigen (211-844 ng), while four animals were injected with a commercial vaccine  (positive control) and four other pigs were mock-vaccinated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the same oil emulsion. Four weeks later, they  were intranasally challenged with 2 × 10(5) TCID50 of a PCV2a strain. Antibody was measured in blood and oral fluids by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a neutralization assay. PCV2 was quantified in serum by real-time polymerase chain reaction for ORF2 gene. PCV2-specific cell-mediated responses were investigated by an IFN-γ release assay in whole blood, IFN-γ ELISPOT, and lymphocyte proliferation (Ki-67 and BrDU assays). All the vaccines under study but mock provided complete or incomplete protection from PCV2 infection in terms  of post-challenge viremia. Serum antibody titers (ELISA and neutralizing) after vaccination were not correlated with protection, as opposed to the early neutralizing antibody levels of vaccinated pigs at day 7 after infection. Cell-mediated immune parameters showed a good correlation with vaccine efficacy.  In particular, the IFN-γ release assay at 3 weeks after vaccination was an effective marker for predicting protection. All control pigs always tested negative in assays of cell-mediated immunity. Our results outline in vitro testing procedures toward reduced animal usage in the control of PCV2 vaccine batches.  DOI: 10.1089/vim.2015.0021 	26401584

Although wild boar can act as a persistent Aujeszky's disease (AD) reservoir, limited data are available on long-term epidemiology in free-ranging wild boar living in areas where industrial swine herds are limited. Hence, this study provides crucial information, which fills this knowledge gap, on the natural dynamics of AD infection. From 3260 sera sampled during eight hunting seasons, 162 (4.97%) were tested positive. Factors, including the animal's age class, and  the sampling year, had significant effects on the probability of the wild boar being seropositive, while wild boar mean abundance per area, yearly abundance and the total number of pig farms, as well as interactions among age, year and sex, were not significant. In particular, a positive trend of seroprevalence was observed over the years, with values ranging from 2.1 to 10.8%. This long-term surveillance showed an increase in seroprevalence with a higher probability of being seropositive in older individuals and the independence of wild boar seropositivity from the likelihood of contact with pigs in the area.

Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a pathogen that infects both animals and humans worldwide. The epidemiology of infection caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis is poorly understood; however, its outbreaks have been traced back to a probable source in wildlife. This study aimed to characterise Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates collected from animals with yersiniosis. This study included 90 isolates of Y. pseudotuberculosis collected from different animals with yersiniosis between 1996 and 2013 in Italy. The isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and were biotyped. Genes associated with virulence plasmid pYV and those encoding O-antigen, high pathogenicity island (HPI), and superantigenic toxin (YPM) were determined by performing PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed using NotI and SpeI enzymes, and 3 dendrograms were generated. No antibiotic resistance was found. The presence of pYV was shown in 57 out of 90 isolates. Virulence profiles of majority of the isolates indicated that they belonged to O:1a and O:1b serotypes, biotype 1, and genetic type 2. Isolates belonging to O:2a serotype were detected in sheep and cattle and were found to be associated (for the first time) with septicemia in hares. Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to O:5a and O:12-O13 serotypes were also detected in hares. To our knowledge, this is the first study to detect Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonging to the O:12-O13 serotype from a clinical case in Europe. Results of PFGE indicated that it was a reliable method for investigating the genetic relatedness of Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates. Thus, characterisation of Y. pseudotuberculosis infection in animals should be considered a possible tool for the surveillance of pseudotuberculosis.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Avian influenza A viruses have gained increasing attention due to their ability to cross the species barrier and cause severe disease in humans and other mammal  species as pigs. H3 and particularly H3N8 viruses, are highly adaptive since they are found in multiple avian and mammal hosts. H3N8 viruses have not been isolated yet from humans; however, a recent report showed that equine influenza A viruses  (IAVs) can be isolated from pigs, although an established infection has not been  observed thus far in this host. To gain insight into the possibility of H3N8 avian IAVs to cross the species barrier into pigs, in vitro experiments and an experimental infection in pigs with four H3N8 viruses from different origins (equine, canine, avian, and seal) were performed. As a positive control, an H3N2  swine influenza virus A was used. Although equine and canine viruses hardly replicated in the respiratory systems of pigs, avian and seal viruses replicated  substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Interestingly, antibodies against hemagglutinin could not be detected after infection by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test with avian and seal viruses. This phenomenon was observed not only in pigs but also in mice immunized with the same virus strains. Our data indicated that H3N8 IAVs from wild aquatic  birds have the potential to cross the species barrier and establish successful infections in pigs that might spread unnoticed using the HAI test as diagnostic tool.IMPORTANCE: Although natural infection of humans with an avian H3N8 influenza A virus has not yet been reported, this influenza A virus subtype has already crossed the species barrier. Therefore, we have examined the potential of H3N8 from canine, equine, avian, and seal origin to productively infect pigs. Our results demonstrated that avian and seal viruses replicated substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Surprisingly, we could not detect specific antibodies against hemagglutinin in any H3N8-infected pigs. Therefore, special attention should be focused toward viruses of the H3N8 subtype since they could behave as stealth viruses in pigs.  Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

The key component of most European pig Salmonella control programmes is the classification of herds according to seroprevalence at slaughter. The objectives  of this study were to estimate the true Salmonella seroprevalence, and investigate the association between the true status of infection and serology in  slaughter heavy pigs. Blood of 3340 pigs was collected and tested with ELISA. From 385 pigs, also lymph nodes and cecal content were collected for bacteriology. Analysis was performed in a Bayesian framework. Results showed that a large proportion of pigs was serologically positive (herd seroprevalence 93% and within-herd seroprevalence higher than 81% in half of herds at cut-off 10 OD%). The association between the true status of infection and serology was not significant, and therefore the classification of heavy pig herds according to seroprevalence at slaughter would not be suitable to reduce the risk of introducing Salmonella into the food chain.

The monophasic variant of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, namely Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i-, has been increasingly responsible for foodborne human cases of disease and is most frequently detected in pork, since the variant is widely spread in pig farms. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of an autologous vaccine in decreasing the prevalence of Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i-, in pigs. The trial was performed in a multisite pig production system of Northern Italy. The autogenous vaccine was prepared from the Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i- strain isolated from the clinical case occurring in the Farm. Different immunization protocols were applied, ranging from interventions only in sows or piglets, or both. Microbiological analysis was performed to assess faecal shedding in sows and their offspring from birth till end of the production cycle  and organ colonization of slaughtered pigs. Body weight of pigs was recorded at different time-points. Humoral immune response was evaluated in serum samples of  sows and piglets. S. Typhimurium 1,4,[5],12:i- determines reduction of animal growth and farm production, furthermore, contamination of carcasses at the slaughterhouse. The load of bacteria entering into the food processing chain is differently influenced by the regimen of administration of inactivated vaccine. In particular, a combined vaccination of sows and their offspring was able to improve the weight gain of growing pigs, to limit Salmonella colonization of organs and to reduce the number of carrier pigs, and hence lowering the risk of introducing Salmonella organisms in the slaughter process.

(3)Department of Veterinary Science and Public Health (Divet), Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.  BACKGROUND: Tularemia is a zoonosis caused by the Francisella tularensis, a highly infectious Gram-negative coccobacillus. Due to easy dissemination, multiple routes of infection, high environmental contamination and morbidity and  mortality rates, Francisella is considered a potential bioterrorism threat and classified as a category A select agent by the CDC. Tick bites are among the most prevalent modes of transmission, and ticks have been indicated as a possible reservoir, although their reservoir competence has yet to be defined. Tick-borne  transmission of F. tularensis was recognized in 1923, and transstadial transmission has been demonstrated in several tick species. Studies on transovarial transmission, however, have reported conflicting results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ticks as reservoirs  for Francisella, assessing the transovarial transmission of F. tularensis subsp.  holarctica in ticks, using experimentally-infected females of Dermacentor reticulatus and Ixodes ricinus. RESULTS: Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization  showed F. tularensis within oocytes. However, cultures and bioassays of eggs and  larvae were negative; in addition, microscopy techniques revealed bacterial degeneration/death in the oocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bacterial death might occur in oocytes, preventing the transovarial transmission of Francisella. We can speculate that Francisella does not have a defined reservoir, but that rather various biological niches (e.g. ticks, rodents), that allow the bacterium to persist in the environment. Our results, suggesting that ticks are not competent for the bacterium vertical transmission, are congruent with this view.  DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0133593  PMCID: PMC4526560	26244842

BACKGROUND: A sudden decline of the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) population in one of the best hunting districts for small game species in northern Germany, the German North-Sea island Pellworm, in the years 2007/08 following marked habitat changes led to the implementation of a thorough health assessment program of the population. 110 animals were collected during the normal hunting season in the years 2010 and 2011. A post-mortem examination and histopathological investigation was performed on all animals. Additionally, routine bacteriology of the small intestine and parasitology were carried out. Sera of hares were tested for European Brown Hare Syndrome (EBHS) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and for Treponema sp. by indirect immunofluorescent test. Additional testing was performed when deemed necessary. RESULTS: The most striking result was a shift in the intestinal bacterial flora towards Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with a predominance of either Escherichia coli, or Aeromonas sp., or a high-grade double-infection with these two pathogens with subsequent catarrhal enteritis. Additionally, a marked coccidiosis, and varying infestations with the nematode Trichostrongylus retortaeformis were found. The sero-prevalence for EBHS was 78.1%, and for Treponema 43.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The shift and decrease in diversity of the intestinal flora was the  main and most consistent result found. In the authors' opinion the change of the  habitat combined with other stressors increased the animals' sensitivity to ubiquitous bacterial species and parasites which usually would not have such fatal effects.

Electronic address: michele.dottori@izsler.it.  Several flaviviruses are important pathogens for humans and animals (Dengue viruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow-fever virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus). In recent years, numerous novel and related flaviviruses without known pathogenic capacity have been isolated worldwide in the natural mosquito population. However, phylogenetic studies have shown that genomic sequences of these viruses diverge from other flaviviruses. Moreover, these viruses seem to be exclusive of insects (they do not seem to grow on vertebrate cell lines), and were already defined as mosquito-only flaviviruses or insect-specific flaviviruses. At least eleven of these viruses were isolated worldwide, and sequences ascribable to other eleven putative viruses were detected in several mosquito species. A large part of the cycle of these viruses  is not well known, and their persistence in the environment is poorly understood. These viruses are detected in a wide variety of distinct mosquito species and also in sandflies and chironomids worldwide; a single virus, or the genetic material ascribable to a virus, was detected in several mosquito species in different countries, often in different continents. Furthermore, some of these viruses are carried by invasive mosquitoes, and do not seem to have a depressive  action on their fitness. The global distribution and the continuous detection of  new viruses in this group point out the likely underestimation of their number, and raise interesting issues about their possible interactions with the pathogenic flaviviruses, and their influence on the bionomics of arthropod hosts. Some enigmatic features, as their integration in the mosquito genome, the recognition of their genetic material in DNA forms in field-collected mosquitoes, or the detection of the same virus in both mosquitoes and sandflies, indicate that the cycle of these viruses has unknown characteristics that could be of use  to reach a deeper understanding of the cycle of related pathogenic flaviviruses.

The emergence in humans of the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus, a complex reassortant virus of swine origin, highlighted the importance of worldwide influenza virus surveillance in swine. To date, large-scale surveillance studies  have been reported for southern China and North America, but such data have not yet been described for Europe. We report the first large-scale genomic characterization of 290 swine influenza viruses collected from 14 European countries between 2009 and 2013. A total of 23 distinct genotypes were identified, with the 7 most common comprising 82% of the incidence. Contrasting epidemiological dynamics were observed for two of these genotypes, H1huN2 and H3N2, with the former showing multiple long-lived geographically isolated lineages, while the latter had short-lived geographically diffuse lineages. At least 32 human-swine transmission events have resulted in A(H1N1)pdm09 becoming established at a mean frequency of 8% across European countries. Notably, swine in the United Kingdom have largely had a replacement of the endemic Eurasian avian virus-like ("avian-like") genotypes with A(H1N1)pdm09-derived genotypes. The high number of reassortant genotypes observed in European swine, combined with the identification of a genotype similar to the A(H3N2)v genotype in North America, underlines the importance of continued swine surveillance in Europe for  the purposes of maintaining public health. This report further reveals that the emergences and drivers of virus evolution in swine differ at the global level.IMPORTANCE: The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus contains a reassortant genome  with segments derived from separate virus lineages that evolved in different regions of the world. In particular, its neuraminidase and matrix segments were derived from the Eurasian avian virus-like ("avian-like") lineage that emerged in European swine in the 1970s. However, while large-scale genomic characterization  of swine has been reported for southern China and North America, no equivalent study has yet been reported for Europe. Surveillance of swine herds across Europe between 2009 and 2013 revealed that the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is established in European swine, increasing the number of circulating lineages in the region and increasing the possibility of the emergence of a genotype with human pandemic potential. It also has implications for veterinary health, making prevention through vaccination more challenging. The identification of a genotype similar to the A(H3N2)v genotype, causing zoonoses at North American agricultural fairs, underlines the importance of continued genomic characterization in European swine.

Poly-γ-glutamate (γ-PGA) is an industrially interesting polymer secreted mainly by members of the class Bacilli which forms a shield able to protect bacteria from phagocytosis and phages. Few enzymes are known to degrade γ-PGA; among them  is a phage-encoded γ-PGA hydrolase, PghP. The supposed role of PghP in phages is  to ensure access to the surface of bacterial cells by dismantling the γ-PGA barrier. We identified four unannotated B. subtilis genes through similarity of their encoded products to PghP; in fact these genes reside in prophage elements of B. subtilis genome. The recombinant products of two of them demonstrate efficient polymer degradation, confirming that sequence similarity reflects functional homology. Genes encoding similar γ-PGA hydrolases were identified in phages specific for the order Bacillales and in numerous microbial genomes, not only belonging to that order. The distribution of the γ-PGA biosynthesis operon was also investigated with a bioinformatics approach; it was found that the list  of organisms endowed with γ-PGA biosynthetic functions is larger than expected and includes several pathogenic species. Moreover in non-Bacillales bacteria the  predicted γ-PGA hydrolase genes are preferentially found in species that do not have the genetic asset for polymer production. Our findings suggest that γ-PGA hydrolase genes might have spread across microbial genomes via horizontal exchanges rather than via phage infection. We hypothesize that, in natural habitats rich in γ-PGA supplied by producer organisms, the availability of hydrolases that release glutamate oligomers from γ-PGA might be a beneficial trait under positive selection.

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of nosocomial infections worldwide. After the spread of strains resistant  to beta-lactams at the end of the previous century, the diffusion of isolates resistant to carbapenems and colistin is now reducing treatment options and the containment of infections. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains have spread rapidly among Italian hospitals, with four subclades of pandemic clonal group 258 (CG258). Here we show that a single Italian hospital has been invaded by three of these subclades within 27 months, thus replicating on a small scale the "Italian  scenario." We identified a single clone responsible for an epidemic outbreak involving seven patients, and we reconstructed its star-like pattern of diffusion within the intensive care unit. This epidemiological picture was obtained through phylogenomic analysis of 16 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates collected in the hospital during a 27-month period, which were added to a database of 319 genomes representing the available global diversity of K. pneumoniae strains. Phenotypic and molecular assays did not reveal virulence or resistance determinants specific for the outbreak isolates. Other factors, rather than selective advantages, might have caused the outbreak. Finally, analyses allowed us to identify a major subclade of CG258 composed of strains bearing the yersiniabactin virulence factor. Our work demonstrates how the use of combined phenotypic, molecular, and whole-genome sequencing techniques can help to identify quickly and to characterize accurately the spread of MDR pathogens.

The presence of foodborne pathogens (Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, thermotolerant Campylobacter, Yersinia enterocolitica and norovirus) in fresh leafy (FL) and ready-to-eat (RTE) vegetable products, sampled at random on the Italian market, was investigated to evaluate the level of risk to consumers. Nine regional laboratories, representing 18 of the 20 regions of Italy and in which 97.7% of the country's population resides, were involved in this study. All laboratories used the same sampling procedures and analytical methods. The vegetable samples were screened using validated real-time PCR (RT-PCR) methods and standardized reference ISO culturing methods. The results show that 3.7% of 1372 fresh leafy vegetable products and 1.8% of 1160 "fresh-cut" or "ready-to-eat" (RTE) vegetable retailed in supermarkets or farm markets, were contaminated with one or more foodborne pathogens harmful to human  health.

Helicobacter pylori is responsible for gastritis and gastric adenocarcinoma in humans, but the routes of transmission of this bacterium have not been clearly defined. Few studies led to supposing that H. pylori could be transmitted through raw milk, and no one investigated the presence of other Helicobacteraceae in milk. In the current work, the presence of Helicobacteraceae was investigated in  the bulk tank milk of dairy cattle herds located in northern Italy both by direct plating onto H. pylori selective medium and by screening PCR for Helicobacteraceae, followed by specific PCRs for H. pylori, Wolinella spp., and "Candidatus Helicobacter bovis." Three out of 163 bulk milk samples tested positive for Helicobacteraceae, but not for the subsequent PCRs. H. pylori was not isolated in any case. However, given similar growth conditions, Arcobacter butzleri, A. cryaerophilus, and A. skirrowii were recovered. In conclusion, the prevalence of Helicobacteraceae in raw milk was negligible (1.8%), and H. pylori  was not identified in any of the positive samples, suggesting that, at least in the farming conditions of the investigated area, bovine milk does not represent a potential source of infection.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common mastitis-causing pathogens worldwide. In the last decade, livestock-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (LA-MRSA) infections have been described in several species, included the  bovines. Hence, this paper investigates the diffusion of MRSA within Italian dairy herds; the strains were further characterized using a DNA microarray, which detects 330 different sequences, including the methicillin-resistance genes mecA  and mecC and SCCmec typing. The analysis of overall patterns allows the assignment to Clonal Complexes (CC). Overall 163 S. aureus isolates, collected from quarter milk samples in 61 herds, were tested. MRSA strains were further processed using spa typing. Fifteen strains (9.2%), isolated in 9 herds (14.75%), carried mecA, but none harboured mecC. MRSA detection was significantly associated (P<0.011) with a within-herd prevalence of S. aureus intra-mammary infections (IMI) ≤5%. Ten MRSA strains were assigned to CC398, the remaining ones to CC97 (n=2), CC1 (n=2) or CC8 (n=1). In 3 herds, MRSA and MSSA co-existed: CC97-MRSA with CC398-MSSA, CC1-MRSA with CC8-MSSA and CC398-MRSA with CC126-MSSA. The results of spa typing showed an overall similar profile of the strains belonging to the same CC: t127-CC1, t1730-CC97, t899 in 8 out of 10 CC398. In the remaining 2 isolates a new spa type, t14644, was identified. The single CC8 was a t3092. The SCCmec cassettes were classified as type IV, type V or type IV/V composite. All or most strains harboured the genes encoding the β-lactamase operon and the tetracycline resistance. Streptogramin resistance gene was related to CC398. Enterotoxin and leukocidin genes were carried only by CC1, CC8 and CC97-MRSA. The persistence of MRSA clones characterized by broader host range, in epidemiologically unrelated areas and in dairy herds with low prevalence of S. aureus IMI, might enhance the risk for adaptation to human species.

Negative staining electron microscopy methods can be employed for the diagnosis of viral particles in animal samples. In fact, negative staining electron microscopy methods are used to identify viruses, especially in minor species and  wild animals, when no other methods are available and in cases of rare, emerging  or re-emerging infections. In particular, immune-electron-microscopy with convalescent sera is employed to detect etiological agents when there are undiagnosed clinical outbreaks, when alternative diagnostic methods fail due to the lack of immunological reagents and primers, and when there is no indicative clinical suspect. An overview of immune-electron-microscopy with convalescent sera's use in the diagnosis of new and unsuspected viruses in animals of domestic and wild species is provided through the descriptions of the following four diagnostic veterinary cases: (I) enteric viruses of pigs: Porcine Rotavirus, Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Porcine Circovirus and Porcine Torovirus; (II) Rotavirus and astrovirus in young turkeys with enteritis; (III) Parvovirus-like particles in pheasants; and (IV) Lagoviruses: Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus and European Brown Hare Syndrome Virus.

Chlamydia abortus, an obligate intracellular bacterium, is the most common infectious cause of abortion in small ruminants worldwide and has zoonotic potential. We applied multilocus sequence typing (MLST) together with multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) to genotype 94 ruminant C. abortus strains, field isolates and samples collected from 1950 to 2011 in diverse geographic locations, with the aim of delineating C. abortus lineages and clones. MLST revealed the previously identified sequence types (STs) ST19, ST25, ST29 and ST30, plus ST86, a recently-assigned type on the Chlamydiales MLST website and ST87, a novel type harbouring the hemN_21 allele, whereas MLVA recognized seven types (MT1 to MT7). Minimum-spanning-tree analysis  suggested that all STs but one (ST30) belonged to a single clonal complex, possibly reflecting the short evolutionary timescale over which the predicted ancestor (ST19) has diversified into three single-locus variants (ST86, ST87 and  ST29) and further, through ST86 diversification, into one double-locus variant (ST25). ST descendants have probably arisen through a point mutation evolution mode. Interestingly, MLVA showed that in the ST19 population there was a greater  genetic diversity than in other STs, most of which exhibited the same MT over time and geographical distribution. However, the evolutionary pathways of C. abortus STs seem to be diverse across geographic distances with individual STs restricted to particular geographic locations. The ST30 singleton clone displaying geographic specificity and represented by the Greek strains LLG and POS was effectively distinguished from the clonal complex lineage, supporting the notion that possibly two separate host adaptations and hence independent bottlenecks of C. abortus have occurred through time. The combination of MLST and MLVA assays provides an additional level of C. abortus discrimination and may prove useful for the investigation and surveillance of emergent C. abortus clonal populations.

Influenza A virus is the principal agent responsible of the respiratory tract's infections in humans. Every year, highly pathogenic and infectious strains with new antigenic assets appear, making ineffective vaccines so far developed. The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) opened the way to the progress of new promising drugs against Influenza A virus and also to the introduction of disease resistance traits in genetically modified animals. In this paper, we show that Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) cassette, designed on a specific conserved region of the nucleoprotein (NP) viral genome, can strongly inhibit the viral replication of four viral strains sharing  the target sequence, reducing the viral mRNA respectively to 2.5×10(-4), 7.5×10(-5), 1.7×10(-3), 1.9×10(-4) compared to the control, as assessed by real-time PCR. Moreover, we demonstrate that during the challenge with a viral strain bearing a single mismatch on the target sequence, although a weaker inhibition is observed, viral mRNA is still lowered down to 1.2×10(-3) folds in the shRNA-expressing clone compared to the control, indicating a broad potential  use of this approach. In addition, we developed a highly predictive and fast screening test of siRNA sequences based on dual-luciferase assay, useful for the  in vitro prediction of the potential effect of viral inhibition. In conclusion, these findings reveal new siRNA sequences able to inhibit Influenza A virus replication and provide a basis for the development of siRNAs as prophylaxis and  therapy for influenza infection both in humans and animals.

Assessing the performance of a surveillance system for infectious diseases of domestic animals is a challenging task for health authorities. Therefore, it is important to assess what strategy is the most effective in identifying the onset  of an epidemic and in minimizing the number of infected farms. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the performance of the bovine tuberculosis (bTB) surveillance system in the network of dairy farms in the Emilia-Romagna (ER) Region, Italy. A bTB-free Region since 2007, ER implements an integrated surveillance strategy based on three components, namely routine on-farm tuberculin skin-testing performed every 3 years, tuberculin skin-testing of cattle exchanged between farms, and post-mortem inspection at slaughterhouses. We assessed the effectiveness of surveillance by means of a stochastic network model of both within-farm and between-farm bTB dynamics calibrated on data available for ER dairy farms. Epidemic dynamics were simulated for five scenarios: the current ER surveillance system, a no surveillance scenario that we used as the benchmark to characterize epidemic dynamics, three additional scenarios in which  one of the surveillance components was removed at a time so as to outline its significance in detecting the infection. For each scenario we ran Monte Carlo simulations of bTB epidemics following the random introduction of an infected individual in the network. System performances were assessed through the comparative analysis of a number of statistics, including the time required for epidemic detection and the total number of infected farms during the epidemic. Our analysis showed that slaughterhouse inspection is the most effective surveillance component in reducing the time for disease detection, while routine  surveillance in reducing the number of multi-farms epidemics. On the other hand,  testing exchanged cattle improved the performance of the surveillance system only marginally.  Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In 2013, the circulation of West Nile virus (WNV) was detected in the Lombardy region and the following year a surveillance programme was activated with the aim of early identification of the viral distribution in mosquitoes and wild birds. A total of 50 959 Culex spp. mosquitoes grouped in six hundred and forty-seven pools as well as 1400 birds were screened by RT-PCR for the presence of West Nile virus leading to the identification of the viral genome in 32 mosquito pools and  13 wild birds. The surveillance was able to detect the WNV circulation on an average of 42 days (CI 95% 29.98-53.86; Student's t-distribution) before the occurrence of human West Nile disease (WND) cases in the same area. These results demonstrate the presence of WNV in the Lombardy region and confirm entomological  and wild birds surveillance as an effective measure for the early identification  of WNV circulation in infected areas, thus providing a useful and cost-effective  tool for the public health authorities in the application of measures to prevent  human infection.  © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

Mortality  data (46,610 cases) referred to dairy cows older than 24mo that died on a farm from all causes from May 1 to September 30 during a 6-yr period (2002-2007). Weather data were obtained from 12 weather stations located in different areas of Italy. Heat waves were defined for each weather station as a period of at least 3 consecutive days, from May 1 to September 30 (2002-2007), when the daily maximum  temperature exceeded the 90th percentile of the reference distribution (1971-2000). Summer days were classified as days in heat wave (HW) or not in heat wave (nHW). Days in HW were numbered to evaluate the relationship between mortality and length of the wave. Finally, the first 3 nHW days after the end of  a heat wave were also considered to account for potential prolonged effects. The  mortality risk was evaluated using a case-crossover design. A conditional logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for mortality recorded in HW compared with that recorded in nHW days pooled and stratified by duration of exposure, age of cows, and month of occurrence. Dairy cows mortality was greater during HW compared with nHW days. Furthermore, compared with nHW days, the risk of mortality continued to be higher during the 3 d after the end of HW. Mortality increased with the length of the HW. Considering deaths stratified by age, cows up to 28mo were not affected by HW, whereas all the other age categories of older cows (29-60, 61-96, and >96mo)  showed a greater mortality when exposed to HW. The risk of death during HW was higher in early summer months. In particular, the highest risk of mortality was observed during June HW. Present results strongly support the implementation of adaptation strategies which may limit heat stress-related impairment of animal welfare and economic losses in dairy cow farm during HW.

BACKGROUND: Bovine Amyloidotic Spongiform Encephalopathy (BASE) is a variant of classical BSE that affects cows and can be transmitted to primates and mice. BASE is biochemically different from BSE and shares some molecular and histo-pathological features with the MV2 sub-type of human sporadic Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (sCJD). RESULTS: The present work examined the effects of BASE on gene expression in circulating immune cells. Ontology analysis of genes differentially expressed between cattle orally challenged with brain homogenate from cattle following intracranial inoculation with BASE and control cattle identified three main pathways which were affected. Within the immune function pathway, the most affected genes were related to the T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation pathways. The differential expression of these genes in BASE challenged animals at 10,12 and 24 months following challenge, vs unchallenged controls, was investigated by real time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that the effects of prion diseases are not limited to the CNS, but involve the immune system and particularly T cell signalling during the early stage following challenge, before the appearance of clinical signs.

Mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) produces renewable energy, but it also plays a role in reducing the impact of digestates, both by reducing odor and pathogen content. Ten full-scale biogas plants characterized by different plant designs (e.g. single digesters, parallel or serial digesters), plant powers (ranging from 180 to 999 kWe), hydraulic retention time (HRT) (ranging between 20 to 70 days) and feed mixes were monitored and odors and pathogens were observed in both ingestates and digestates. Results obtained indicated that MAD reduced odors (OU) from, on average, OUingestate=99,106±149,173 OU m(-2) h(-1) (n=15) to OU digestate=1106±771 OU m(-2) h(-1) (n=15). Pathogens were also reduced during MAD  both because of ammonia production during the process and competition for substrate between pathogens and indigenous microflora, i.e. Enterobacteriaceae from 6.85∗10(3)±1.8∗10(1) to 1.82∗10(1)±3.82∗10(1); fecal Coliform from 1.82∗10(4)±9.09 to 2.45∗10(1)±3.8∗10(1); Escherichia coli from 8.72∗10(3)±2.4∗10(1) to 1.8∗10(1)±2.94∗10(1); Clostridium perfringens from 6.4∗10(4)±7.7 to 5.2∗10(3)±8.1 (all data are expressed as CFU g(-1) ww). Plants showed different abilities to reduce pathogen indicators, depending on the pH value and toxic ammonia content.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the nucleocapsid (N) protein or the glycoprotein Gc of Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a novel member of the Simbu  serogroup (genus Orthobunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae), was produced and used to  analyze antigenic differences among members of this serogroup. Reactivity with various SBV-isolates and other Simbu serogroup viruses was assessed by an indirect immunofluorescence test and by immunoblotting. The Gc-specific mAbs detected different SBV isolates as well as two closely related members of the Simbu serogroup. In addition, one mAb showed a highly specific reactivity with the homologous SBV strain only. Based on their differing reactivity with different SBV-strains, these antibodies represent a valuable novel tool to rapidly determine the phenotype of new SBV isolates. In contrast, the N-specific  mAbs showed a broad reactivity spectrum and detected not only all the tested SBV-isolates, but also several other viruses of the Simbu serogroup. One out of these mAbs even recognized all of the tested Simbu serogroup viruses in the indirect immunofluorescence assay. In order to further characterize the N-specific antibodies, PepScan analysis was performed and a specific epitope could be identified. In summary, the newly generated mAbs showed differing pan-Simbu virus-, pan-SBV- as well as SBV-isolate-specific reactivity patterns. Thus, they represent valuable tools for the development of novel antigen and antibody detection systems either specific for SBV or, in a broader approach, for the pan-Simbu serogroup diagnostics.

BACKGROUND: Understanding wildlife disease ecology is becoming an urgent need due to the continuous emergence and spread of several wildlife zoonotic diseases. West Nile Virus (WNV) is the most widespread arthropod-borne virus in the world,  and in recent decades there has been an increase both in geographic range, and in the frequency of symptomatic infections in humans and wildlife. The principal vector for WNV in Europe is the common house Culex pipiens mosquito, which feeds  on a wide variety of vertebrate host species. Variation in mosquito feeding preference has been described as one of the most influential parameters driving intensity and timing of WNV infection in the United States, but feeding preferences for this species have been little studied in Europe. METHODS: Here, we estimated feeding preference for wild Cx. pipiens in northern Italy, using molecular analysis to identify the origin of blood meals, and avian  census to control host abundance variations. Additionally, we used host bird odour extracts to test experimentally mosquito preferences in the absence of environmental variations. RESULTS: For the first time, we demonstrate a clear feeding preference for the common blackbird (Turdus merula), both for wild collected specimens and in the lab, suggesting a potential important role for this species in the WNV epidemiology in Europe. A seasonal decrease in abundance of blackbirds is associated with increased feeding on Eurasian magpies (Pica pica), and this may be linked to seasonal emergence of WNV in humans. Feeding preferences on blackbirds are more marked in rural areas, while preference for magpies is higher in peridomestic areas. Other species, such as the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) appear to be selected by mosquitoes opportunistically in relation to  its abundance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new insights into the ecology of Cx. pipiens in Europe and may give useful indications in terms of implementing targeted WNV surveillance plans. However, a clearer understanding of spatio-temporal variations of Cx. pipiens feeding preferences, and targeted studies on reservoir  competence for WNV for these species are therefore now urgently needed as this is essential to describe disease dynamics and quantify virus transmission risk.

Heterogeneity in transmission and stochastic events can play a significant role in shaping the epidemic dynamics of vector-borne infections, especially in the initial phase of an outbreak. In this work, by using multi-type branching process methodologies, we assess how heterogeneities in transmission among a large number of host groups can affect the invasion probabilities of a mosquito-borne disease. We show with both analytical and numerical methods that heterogeneities in transmission can shape the invasion probabilities differently from how they affect the basic reproduction number (R0). In particular, we find that, while R0  always increases with the heterogeneity, the invasion probability after the introduction of infected hosts can decrease with the increase of transmission heterogeneity, even approaching zero when the number of host groups is very large. In addition, we show that the invasion probability via infected vectors is always larger than via infected hosts when heterogeneous transmission is sufficiently high. Our findings suggest that, for multi-species infections (e.g.  West Nile fever and Rift Valley fever) or for single-species infections with patchy host distribution, the introduction of primary infected vectors may represent a higher risk for major outbreaks occurrence than introductions of infected hosts.

Paratuberculosis of ruminants is characterised by chronic enteritis but, at advanced stages of the disease, a systemic dissemination of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in tissues and organs can occur. MAP has been recovered from lymph nodes and muscles of clinical and sub-clinical cows. In most countries, dairy and beef cattle infected with paratuberculosis are routinely sent to slaughter and the consumption of their meat could be a possible route of  human exposure to MAP. However, few studies on MAP in ground beef are currently available. During the period November 2013-March 2014 we carried out a survey on  the ground beef produced in an industrial meat processing plant. One-hundred and  forty samples of ground meat were analysed by IS900-qPCR and culture (VersaTrek System). The limit of detection (LOD) of qPCR was 630 MAP cells/g (107 CFU/g) while the LOD for culture was 170-230 MAP cells/g (62-115 CFU/g). No samples were positive by direct IS900 qPCR, while two samples were positive by liquid culture. Our data suggest that the presence of live MAP in raw minced meat is possible. In order to avoid exposure for humans through the consumption of contaminated meat,  proper cooking of meat is recommended.  Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(3)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Milan, Italy.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of the survey was to evaluate Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence in small ruminants and possible risk factors associated with the infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sera from 474 goats and 502 sheep reared on 42 farms in northern Italy were collected and tested for IgG antibodies to T. gondii by IFAT  (indirect immunofluorescence antibody test). To identify risk factors, a binary logistic regression analysis of the variables was performed. An audit form about  farm management was used. RESULTS: Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 96.6% of goat farms and in 87.5% of sheep farms; 41.7% goats and 59.3% sheep resulted positive. Seroprevalence was significantly higher in sheep than in goats. Seroprevalence values were similar in goats from eastern and western areas, whereas goats from the southern area were at lower risk of infection. Saanen goats presented the lowest seroprevalence (30.7 %), whereas cross-breed exhibited the highest rate (48.7%). Goats from farms housing both sheep and goats had an infection risk 1.39 times higher than goats from farms that did not house sheep. Animals bred on intensive farms showed lower prevalence (22.1%) in comparison with those from extensive (45.6%) or semi-intensive farms (60%). Sampling area was one of the strongest predictors of  T. gondii infection in sheep flocks. Transhumant flocks showed a higher risk of infection by T. gondii compared with semi-intensive farms (66.8% vs. 38.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The highest T. gondii seroprevalence values were registered in transhumant flocks of sheep and in family businesses rearing goats. As these traditional activities represent an important resource for the conservation of the territory and its economy, management practices for a better control of the disease should be improved.

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a postsuppurative sequela caused by Streptococcus  pyogenes infections affecting school-age children. We describe here the occurrence of an ARF outbreak that occurred in Bologna province, northeastern Italy, between November 2012 and May 2013. Molecular analysis revealed that ARF-related group A Streptococcus (GAS) strains belonged to the M-18 serotype, including subtypes emm18.29 and emm18.32. All M-18 GAS strains shared the same antigenic profile, including SpeA, SpeB, SpeC, SpeL, SpeM, and SmeZ. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis revealed that M-18 GAS strains grouped separately from other serotypes, suggesting a different S. pyogenes lineage. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and phylogenetic analysis based on whole-genome sequencing showed that emm18.29 and emm18.32 GAS strains clustered in two distinct groups, highlighting genetic variations between these subtypes. Comparative analysis revealed a similar genome architecture between emm18.29 and emm18.32 strains that differed from noninvasive emm18.0 strains. The major sources of differences between M-18 genomes were attributable to the prophage elements. Prophage regions contained several virulence factors that could have contributed to the pathogenic potential of emm18.29 and emm18.32 strains. Notably, phage ΦSPBO.1 carried erythrogenic toxin  A gene (speA1) in six ARF-related M-18 GAS strains but not in emm18.0 strains. In addition, a phage-encoded hyaluronidase gene (hylP.2) presented different variants among M-18 GAS strains by showing internal deletions located in the α-helical and TSβH regions. In conclusion, our study yielded insights into the genome structure of M-18 GAS strains responsible for the ARF outbreak in Italy, thus expanding our knowledge of this serotype.

Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2) is involved in porcine circovirus-associated disease, that causes great economic losses to the livestock industry worldwide. Vaccination against PCV2 proved to be very effective in reducing disease occurrence and it is currently performed on a large scale. Starting from a previous model concerning Foot-and Mouth Disease Virus antigens, we developed a rapid and simple method to quantify PCV2 whole virion particles in inactivated vaccines. This procedure, based on sucrose gradient analysis and fluorometric evaluation of viral genomic content, allows for a better standardization of the antigen payload in vaccine batches. It also provides a valid indication of virion integrity. Most important, such a method can be applied to whole virion vaccines  regardless of the production procedures, thus enabling meaningful comparisons on  a common basis. In a future batch consistency approach to PCV2 vaccine manufacture, our procedure represents a valuable tool to improve in-process controls and to guarantee conformity of the final product with passmarks for approval. This might have important repercussions in terms of reduced usage of animals for vaccine batch release, in the framework of the current 3Rs policy.

We retrospectively analyzed a rare Salmonella enterica serovar Manhattan outbreak that occurred in Italy in 2009 to evaluate the potential of new genomic tools based on differential single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis in comparison with the gold standard genotyping method, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 39 isolates were analyzed from patients (n=15) and food, feed, animal, and environmental sources (n=24), resulting in five different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. Isolates epidemiologically related to the outbreak clustered within the same pulsotype, SXB_BS.0003, without any further differentiation. Thirty-three isolates were considered for genomic analysis based on different sets of SNPs, core, synonymous, nonsynonymous, as well as SNPs in different codon positions, by Bayesian and maximum likelihood algorithms. Trees generated from core and nonsynonymous SNPs, as well as SNPs at the second and first plus second codon positions detailed four distinct groups of isolates within the outbreak pulsotype, discriminating outbreak-related isolates of human  and food origins. Conversely, the trees derived from synonymous and third-codon-position SNPs clustered food and human isolates together, indicating  that all outbreak-related isolates constituted a single clone, which was in line  with the epidemiological evidence. Further experiments are in place to extend this approach within our regional enteropathogen surveillance system.  Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

Staphylococcus aureus is regarded as a leading cause of mastitis in goats. However, few data are available on the presence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in this species. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA in bulk tank milk samples from dairy goat farms in Northern Italy. Eighty-five out of 197 samples (43.1%) tested positive for S. aureus with  counts ranging from 10 to more than 1.5 × 10(4) cfu/mL. The MRSA was screened by  both direct plating followed by a disk diffusion test to evaluate methicillin resistance and a selective enrichment method. Methicillin-resistance was confirmed by mecA-specific PCR. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was identified in 4 samples (2.0%) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed the presence of livestock-associated MRSA belonging to lineages ST398 (n = 3) and ST1 (n = 1). In one case we demonstrated that the same MRSA strain was able to persist over time  on the farm, being isolated from both bulk tank milk and the udder of 3 goats 1 yr after the first isolation. The high prevalence of S. aureus-positive herds detected in this study and the presence of MRSA strains belonging to livestock-associated genotypes is of concern, and represents a novel finding in the Italian dairy goat production system. The application of stringent measures for the control of S. aureus mastitis at the farm level seems appropriate to reduce the economic losses, and to minimize the risk of foodborne illness and the transmission of MRSA to humans by occupational exposure.

In 2012-2013 Emilia-Romagna Region introduced a monitoring plan for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in foodstuff. Six hundred eighty-nine meat samples and 273 fruit and vegetable products were analyzed according to ISOTS13136. Pre-enriched samples were tested by multiplex real time PCR targeting the virulence genes eae, stx1 and stx2. Stx2 positive samples were investigated for the presence of serogroup O104 associated gene. O103, O111, O145, O157, O26 associated genes were tested on samples positive for stx in association with eae  gene. Isolation of E. coli strains was attempted from samples positive for serogroup-associated genes. Thirty-four meat products (4.9%) resulted positive for stx1 and/or stx2 genes and 46 (6.7%) for stx1 and/or stx2 genes in association with eae gene. Forty-five (6.5%) samples resulted positive at least at one serogroup. Serogroup O103, O104, O111, O145, O157 and O26 genes were detected respectively in 1.3, 0.3, 0.1, 3.9, 2.9 and 2.5% samples; 0.6% samples resulted positive for STEC isolation (2 E. coli O103 and 2 E. coli O157). It is worth noting that STEC virulence genes were detected at high frequency (19%) in fresh pork meat sausages. Four (1.5%) vegetable samples were positive for stx1 and/or stx2 genes and 1 (0.4%) for stx1 and/or stx2 genes in association with eae gene; none resulted positive for the tested serogroups. Only a low number of samples positive by molecular methods were confirmed by cultural isolation. It is therefore of the uttermost importance for appropriate risk management, to be fully aware of the meaning of the analytical result.  DOI: 10.4081/ijfs.2015.4511  PMCID: PMC5076621	27800377

Case-study and risk management of dioxins and PCBs bovine milk contaminations in  a high industrialized area in Northern Italy.  Bertocchi L(1), Ghidini S, Fedrizzi G, Lorenzi V.  Author information:  (1)Primary Production Department, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna "Bruno Ubertini", Via Bianchi, 9, 25124, Brescia, Italy.  Milk supplied to a dairy plant in Brescia City (Northern Italy) was found to be contaminated by dioxin like PCBs at levels above the European (EU) action limit (2 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat). As a consequence, 14 dairy farms were sampled individually, in order to identify and possibly eliminate the source of contamination. All the  farms were located in Brescia or just nearby, an area that is characterized by a  strong industrialization. Four out of the 14 farms showed contamination levels above the legal maximum limit set by European Commission at 5.5 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat  for the sum of dioxins and DL-PCBs. Concentrations of 8.16, 6.83, 5.71 and 5.65 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat were detected. In the three most polluted farms, cow ration was  substituted with feed coming from uncontaminated areas and the time needed to reduce milk pollution was evaluated. In all the three farms, contamination levels dropped below the EU legal limit after only 1 month from the removal of the pollution source. In each sampled farm, DL-PCBs were the major contributors to the total WHO-TEQ level, with percentages up to 87% in the most contaminated one. PCB 126 WHO-TEQ value explained by itself large part of this contamination, and its decrease was fundamental for the reduction of milk contamination levels. This study provides an example of an on-field successful emergency intervention that succeeded in decontamination of dairy cows, allowing a fast restart of their production activity.

Mycobacterium microti has recently been described as the causative agent of tuberculosis-like lesions in wild boar (Sus scrofa), a reservoir specie of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in some European Mediterranean ecosystem. Through a five-year survey on tuberculosis in free-living wild boars,  the epidemiological trend of M. microti infections and the host and population risk factors linked with its occurrence were described. Retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes of 3041 hunted wild boars from six different districts were macroscopically inspected. The sex and age of each animal were registered, as well as the animal abundance in each district. Lesions compatible with tuberculosis (190) were collected and analysed using a gyrB PCR-RFLP assay. M. microti was identified directly in 99 tissue samples (Prev = 3.26%; 95% CI: 2.67-3.97%), while neither Mycobacterium bovis, nor other members of the MTBC were detected. The probability of being M. microti positive showed spatio-temporal variability, with 26% of increase of risk of being infected for each year. Moreover, a positive effect of wild boar abundance and age on the prevalence was detected. The generalized increase in the European wild boar population, coupled with its sensitivity to M. microti infection, poses a future  concern for the identification and management of MTBC members in wild boar.  © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

The use of antibiotics on lactating cows should be monitored for the possible risk of milk contamination with residues. Accordingly, Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) are established by the European Commission to guarantee consumers safety.  As pointed out by Dec 2002/657/EC, screening is the first step in the strategy for antibiotic residue control, thus playing a key role in the whole control procedure. However, current routine screening methods applied in milk chain still fail to detect residues of quinolones at concentrations of interest. This paper reports the findings of a new bio-optical method for the screening of quinolones  residues in bovine milk, based on E. coli ATCC 11303 growth inhibition. The effect of blank and spiked cow milk samples (aliquots equivalents to 0.8%, v/v) is evaluated in Mueller Hinton Broth (MHb) and MHb enriched with MgSO4 2% (MHb-Mg) inoculated with the test strain at the concentration of 10(4)CFU/mL. The presence of quinolones inhibits the cellular growth in MHb, while this effect is  neutralized in MHb-Mg allowing both detection and presumptive identification of quinolones. Growth of the test strain is monitored at 37 °C in a Bioscreen C automated system, and Optical Density (OD) at 600 nm is recorded every 10 min after shaking for 10s. Growth curves (OD vs. time) of E. coli ATCC 11303 are assessed in milk samples, with and without quinolones, and their differences in terms of ΔOD (ΔOD600nm=ODMHb-Mg-ODMHb) are calculated. The presence of quinolones is detected by the cellular growth inhibition (OD vs time, none increase in the value OD) and presumptively identified through the increase of the slope of ΔOD600nm curve (ΔOD vs. time), after about 3h of incubation. The detection limit  for ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin is at the level of MRL, for marbofloxacin is at 2-fold the MRL whereas for danofloxacin is at 4-fold the MRL. Although the sensitivity of the method could be further improved and the procedure automated,  it is a promising step forward to integrate screening assays into the control process and, in particular, to fill in the gap for quinolones; moreover, these technological developments contribute to the One Health perspective through the monitoring of safe and correct use of veterinary antibiotics.

Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto, Italy.  OBJECTIVES: Pyrazinamide-resistant Mycobacterium bovis isolates of animal origin  were assessed for drug susceptibility to five antituberculosis drugs by the agar  based Middlebrook 7H11 method as gold standard as well as by a simplified, dichotomous resazurin microtitre assay (d-REMA). METHODS: A total of 53 M. bovis isolates were typed and tested against isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, ethambutol, kanamycin and the control drug pyrazinamide.  On the basis of the results obtained, pncA and embB genes were PCR-amplified and  DNA-sequenced for all isolates. RESULTS: All M. bovis isolates, classified into 21 spoligotype/MIRU-VNTR profiles, were resistant to pyrazinamide by both methods, as expected. The pncA gene sequencing confirmed the presence of the resistance-conferring H57D mutation. All strains were found to be susceptible to the other five drugs by the agar based gold standard method. The d-REMA was in agreement with these results for all five drugs, with the exception of 12 isolates, which showed ambiguous and therefore inconclusive results in ethambutol testing. Mutations in the embB gene  were observed in all 53 isolates: four new single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. No association was found between embB genetic profiles and ethambutol resistance results by the gold standard. CONCLUSION: All M. bovis isolates were sensitive to the most common antituberculosis drugs used for treatment. There was a good agreement between the d-REMA assay and the agar based reference method. Among ethambutol susceptible isolates, four new embB mutations were found.  Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijid.2014.12.043 	25554388

In continuing two previous networks that initiated the surveillance of swine influenza viruses (SIVs) circulating in European pigs between 2001 and 2008, a third European Surveillance Network for Influenza in Pigs (ESNIP3, 2010-2013) aimed to expand widely the knowledge of the epidemiology of European SIVs. ESNIP3 stimulated programs of harmonized SIV surveillance in European countries and supported the coordination of appropriate diagnostic tools and subtyping methods. Thus, an extensive virological monitoring, mainly conducted through passive surveillance programs, resulted in the examination of more than 9 000 herds in 17 countries. Influenza A viruses were detected in 31% of herds examined from which  1887 viruses were preliminary characterized. The dominating subtypes were the three European enzootic SIVs: avian-like swine H1N1 (53.6%), human-like reassortant swine H1N2 (13%) and human-like reassortant swine H3N2 (9.1%), as well as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus (10.3%). Viruses from these four lineages co-circulated in several countries but with very different relative levels of incidence. For instance, the H3N2 subtype was not detected at all in some geographic areas whereas it was still prevalent in other parts of Europe. Interestingly, H3N2-free areas were those that exhibited highest frequencies of circulating H1N2 viruses. H1N1pdm viruses were isolated at an increasing incidence in some countries from 2010 to 2013, indicating that this subtype has become established in the European pig population. Finally, 13.9% of the viruses  represented reassortants between these four lineages, especially between previous enzootic SIVs and H1N1pdm. These novel viruses were detected at the same time in  several countries, with increasing prevalence. Some of them might become established in pig herds, causing implications for zoonotic infections.  DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0115815  PMCID: PMC4277368	25542013

The aim of this work was to study the microbiological and physico-chemical changes throughout three cheesemaking replicates of Italian Formaggelle di capra  cheese made from raw goat milk. Therefore, during the process, three samples of milk, curd and cheese at 3, 7, 11, 14, 21 and 30 days of ripening old cheese were taken from three cheesemaking replicates. The average of total mesophilic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae count in raw milk was 5.27±0.57 and 3.8±1.02 Log  cfu/mL, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria was the predominant bacterial group during the process, and they developed in different ways in each of the media used (M17 and MRS agar). Variability of microbial concentrations was observed between three cheesemaking replicates. A correlation between the presence of higher levels of Enterobacteriaceae in milk and the presence of other contaminants bacteria such as Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase-positive and coagulase-positive staphylococci was observed. In cheesemaking replicate n. 2, E. coli level was 5.07±0.03 Log cfu/mL and increased by about 1 log until the last week of ripening, when the level decreased to 5.69±0.2 Log cfu/mL. The milk used  for the cheesemaking replicate n. 2 was found to be contaminated also by coagulase-positive staphylococci (3.18±0.06 Log cfu/mL), but the behaviour of this group appeared to be very variable. In this study a first step of process control and microbial groups study was performed and the cheesemaking process was registered in the website www.ars-alimentaria.it, the Italian site supported by the Italian Board of Health.

BACKGROUND: Salmonella spp. have been isolated from a wide range of wild animals. Opportunistic wild carnivores such as red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and badgers (Meles meles) may act as environmental indicators or as potential sources of salmonellosis in humans. The present study characterizes Salmonella spp. isolated from the intestinal contents of hunted or dead red foxes (n = 509) and badgers (n = 17) in northern Italy. FINDINGS: Thirty-one strains of Salmonella belonging to 3 Salmonella enterica subspecies were isolated. Fourteen different serovars of S. enterica subsp. enterica were identified, among which were serovars often associated with human illness. CONCLUSIONS: Wild opportunistic predators can influence the probability of infection of both domestic animals and humans through active shedding of the pathogen to the environment. The epidemiological role of wild carnivores in the spread of salmonellosis needs to be further studied.  DOI: 10.1186/s13028-014-0086-7  PMCID: PMC4266207	25492524

BACKGROUND: Bovine besnoitiosis, caused by the apicomplexan Besnoitia besnoiti, is a chronic and debilitating disease considered as emerging in Europe. In Spain, Portugal and France it is endemic and foci of infection were recorded in Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Greece and Italy. In Italy, cases of bovine besnoitiosis were registered both in imported and autochthonous cattle, and mostly in central  regions; high seroprevalence was also revealed by an epidemiological survey performed in the southern part of the country. Aiming to update information on the disease in northwestern and insular areas of Italy, where data on bovine besnoitiosis were missing, a serosurvey was designed for the present study. METHODS: Three thousand one hundred and forty bovine blood samples from both dairy and beef farms (n = 126) were collected in northwestern regions (Lombardy,  Piedmont and Liguria) and in the island of Sardinia. Samples were analyzed by a standardized in-house ELISA and those resulted positive were re-tested by Western Blot (WB) for confirmation. On results obtained by both ELISA and WB, apparent (AP) and true prevalence (TP) were calculated at individual and herd levels. Further, a panel of sera resulted positive to ELISA was analyzed by IFAT. RESULTS: A total of 712 animals (AP = 22.7%; TP = 18.8%) and 109 farms (AP = 86.5%; TP = 88.2%) showed a positive reaction in ELISA. Only ten (AP = 0.3%; TP = 0%) specimens proceeding from five farms (AP = 3.9%; TP = 1.7%)  from Lombardy were confirmed positive to the WB, corresponding to two Holstein Friesian cows and eight beef cattle. IFAT showed a low sensitivity (44.4%) scoring positive in only four samples out of 9 positive to WB. CONCLUSIONS: The survey demonstrated that bovine besnoitiosis cannot still be considered endemic in whole Italy. In fact, independent foci of infection were registered only in Lombardy region. Therefore, a sanitary strategy aimed to increase control measures and to organize monitoring plans, by adequate diagnostic tools is necessary to avoid overestimation of B. besnoiti in Italy.

Swine dysentery is a mucohaemorrhagic colitis of pigs caused by infection with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. The disease can be controlled by treatment with antimicrobial agents, with the pleuromutilins tiamulin and valnemulin being widely used. In recent years, the occurrence of B. hyodysenteriae with reduced susceptibility to these drugs has been increasing. The aim of this study was to determine temporal changes in genetic groups and pleuromutilin susceptibility amongst B. hyodysenteriae isolates from Italy. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)  was performed on 108 isolates recovered from 87 farms in different regions of Italy from 2003 to 2012, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for tiamulin and valnemulin were determined. Logistic regression was performed to assess associations between susceptibility to the two antimicrobial agents and genetic group, year and region of isolation. The isolates were allocated to 23 sequence types (STs), with five clonal clusters (Ccs) and seven singletons. More  than 50% of isolates were resistant to both pleuromutilins (MIC >2.0 µg/mL for tiamulin and >1.0 µg/mL for valnemulin). All 10 isolates in ST 83 were resistant; these were first isolated in 2011 and came from nine farms, suggesting recent widespread dissemination of a resistant strain. Significant associations were found between the proportion of pleuromutilin susceptible isolates and the genetic group and year of isolation. Although resistant isolates were found in all Ccs, isolates in Ccs 2 and 7 were over five times more likely to be susceptible than those in the other Ccs. A significant trend in the reduction of  susceptibility over time also was observed.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.10.033 	25486860

Foot-and-mouth disease viruses are often restricted to specific geographical regions and spread to new areas may lead to significant epidemics. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of the VP1 genome region of recent outbreak viruses from Libya and Saudi Arabia has revealed a lineage, O-Ind-2001, normally found in the  Indian subcontinent. This paper describes the characterization of field viruses collected from these cases and provides information about a new real-time RT-PCR  assay that can be used to detect viruses from this lineage and discriminate them  from other endemic FMD viruses that are co-circulating in North Africa and western Eurasia.  © 2014 The Authors.

Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus Lagovirus, causes rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), a fatal hepatitis of rabbits, not previously reported in hares. Recently, a new RHDV-related virus emerged, called RHDV2. This lagovirus can cause RHD in rabbits and disease and mortality in Lepus capensis (Cape hare). Here we describe a case of RHDV2 infection in another hare species,  Lepus corsicanus, during a concurrent RHD outbreak in a group of wild rabbits. The same RHDV2 strain infected rabbits and a hare, also causing a RHD-like syndrome in the latter. Our findings confirmed the capability of RHDV2 to infect  hosts other than rabbits and improve the knowledge about the epidemiology and the host range of this new lagovirus.

Phenotypic characterization and ERIC-PCR based genotyping of Paenibacillus larvae isolates recovered from American foulbrood outbreaks in honey bees from Italy.  Bassi S(1), Formato G, Milito M, Trevisiol K, Salogni C, Carra E.  Author information:  (1)a Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna  , Sezione di Modena , Modena , Italy.  BACKGROUND: Paenibacillus larvae is the etiological agent of American foulbrood (AFB), a widespread and severe bacterial brood disease of honey bees. The genomic characterization of P. larvae strains by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) is able to differentiate four genotypes (ERIC I, ERIC II, ERIC III, ERIC IV). The information on the presence of P. larvae ERIC genotypes worldwide is few. OBJECTIVES: We have characterized P. larvae strains isolated in Italy from AFB outbreaks to obtain information on ERIC genotypes and phenotypes of the strains circulating in the country. METHODS: A total of 117 P. larvae isolates from 115 AFB outbreaks occurring in 2008-2012 were subjected to phenotypic and genetic characterization. RESULTS: The genomic characterization allowed the identification of ERIC I and ERIC II genotypes. Examining the data of Northern and Central Italy separately it was noted that in Northern Italy most outbreaks were caused by the ERIC I genotype (78.6%), followed by the ERIC II genotype (18.6%) and by co-infections (ERIC I + ERIC II) (2.6%). In Central Italy, only outbreaks caused by the ERIC I  genotype were observed. With regard to phenotypic characteristics all examined strains of ERIC II genotype fermented fructose while no strains of ERIC I genotype possessed this ability. CONCLUSION: Both P. larvae ERIC I and ERIC II genotypes were isolated from the AFB outbreaks, but ERIC II genotype was isolated only in Northern Italy. The fermentation of fructose seems to be a genotype-specific biochemical marker.  DOI: 10.1080/01652176.2014.993095 	25431956

Lombardo T(1), Dotti S, Villa R, Cinotti S, Ferrari M.  Author information:  (1)Cell Culture Centre, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy.  Biobanking is an essential tool for ensuring easy availability of high-quality biomaterial collections that combine essential samples and epidemiological, clinical, and research data for the scientific community. Specimen collection is  an integral part of clinical research. Indeed, every year throughout the world, millions of biological samples are stored for diagnostics and research, but in many fields the lack of biological material and models is a major hindrance for ongoing research. A biobank facility provides suitable samples for large-scale screening studies and database repositories. Software dedicated to biological banks simplify sample registration and identification, the cataloging of sample properties (type of sample/specimen, associated diseases and/or therapeutic protocols, environmental information, etc.), sample tracking, quality assurance,  and specimen availability characterized by well-defined features. Biobank facilities must adopt good laboratory practices (GLPs) and a stringent quality control system and also comply with ethical issues, when required. The creation of a veterinary network can be useful under different aspects: the first one is related to the importance of animal sciences itself to improve research and strategies in the different branches of the veterinary area, and the second aspect is related to the possibility of data management harmonization to improve  scientific cooperation.

The spread of tick-borne pathogens represents an important threat to human and animal health in many parts of Eurasia. Here, we analysed a 9-year time series of Ixodes ricinus ticks feeding on Apodemus flavicollis mice (main reservoir-competent host for tick-borne encephalitis, TBE) sampled in Trentino (Northern Italy). The tail of the distribution of the number of ticks per host was fitted by three theoretical distributions: Negative Binomial (NB), Poisson-LogNormal (PoiLN), and Power-Law (PL). The fit with theoretical distributions indicated that the tail of the tick infestation pattern on mice is  better described by the PL distribution. Moreover, we found that the tail of the  distribution significantly changes with seasonal variations in host abundance. In order to investigate the effect of different tails of tick distribution on the invasion of a non-systemically transmitted pathogen, we simulated the transmission of a TBE-like virus between susceptible and infective ticks using a  stochastic model. Model simulations indicated different outcomes of disease spreading when considering different distribution laws of ticks among hosts. Specifically, we found that the epidemic threshold and the prevalence equilibria  obtained in epidemiological simulations with PL distribution are a good approximation of those observed in simulations feed by the empirical distribution. Moreover, we also found that the epidemic threshold for disease invasion was lower when considering the seasonal variation of tick aggregation.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is at the forefront of antimicrobial resistance for Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, as strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems are widely reported. The worldwide diffusion of these strains is of great concern due to the high morbidity and mortality often associated with K. pneumoniae infections in nosocomial environments. We sequenced the genomes of 89 K. pneumoniae strains isolated in six Italian hospitals. Strains were selected based on antibiotypes, regardless of multilocus sequence type, to obtain a picture of the epidemiology of K. pneumoniae in Italy. Thirty-one strains were carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae carbapenemase producers, 29 were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, and 29 were susceptible to the aforementioned antibiotics. The genomes were compared to all of the sequences available in the databases, obtaining a data set of 319 genomes  spanning the known diversity of K. pneumoniae worldwide. Bioinformatic analyses of this global data set allowed us to construct a whole-species phylogeny, to detect patterns of antibiotic resistance distribution, and to date the differentiation between specific clades of interest. Finally, we detected an ∼ 1.3-Mb recombination that characterizes all of the isolates of clonal complex 258, the most widespread carbapenem-resistant group of K. pneumoniae. The evolution of this complex was modeled, dating the newly detected and the previously reported recombination events. The present study contributes to the understanding of K. pneumoniae evolution, providing novel insights into its global genomic characteristics and drawing a dated epidemiological scenario for this pathogen in Italy.

The study was based on data collected during 5 yr (2003-2007) and was aimed at assessing the effects of the month, slaughter house of destination (differing for stocking density, openings, brightness, and cooling device types), length of the  journey, and temperature-humidity index (THI) on mortality of heavy slaughter pigs (approximately 160 kg live weight) during transport and lairage. Data were obtained from 24,098 journeys and 3,676,153 pigs transported from 1,618 farms to  3 slaughter houses. Individual shipments were the unit of observation. The terms  dead on arrival (DOA) and dead in pen (DIP) refer to pigs that died during transport and in lairage at the abattoir before slaughtering, respectively. These 2 variables were assessed as the dependent counts in separate univariate Poisson  regressions. The independent variables assessed univariately in each set of regressions were month of shipment, slaughter house of destination, time traveled, and each combination of the month with the time traveled. Two separate  piecewise regressions were done. One used DOA counts within THI levels over pigs  transported as a dependent ratio and the second used DIP counts within THI levels over pigs from a transport kept in lairage as a dependent ratio. The THI was the  sole independent variable in each case. The month with the greatest frequency of  deaths was July with a risk ratio of 1.22 (confidence interval: 1.06-1.36; P < 0.05) and 1.27 (confidence interval: 1.06-1.51; P < 0.05) for DOA and DIP, respectively. The lower mortality risk ratios for DOA and DIP were recorded for January and March (P < 0.05). The aggregated data of the summer (June, July, and  August) versus non-summer (January, March, September, and November) months showed a greater risk of pigs dying during the hot season when considering both transport and lairage (P < 0.05). The mortality risk ratio of DIP was lower at the slaughter house with the lowest stocking density (0.64 m(2)/100 kg live weight), large open windows on the roof and sidewalls, low brightness (40 lx) lights, and high-pressure sprinklers as cooling devices. The mortality risk ratio of DOA increased significantly for journeys longer than 2 h, whereas no relationship was found between length of transport and DIP. The piecewise analysis pointed out that 78.5 and 73.6 THI were the thresholds above which the mortality rate increased significantly for DOA and DIP, respectively. These results may help the pig industry to improve the welfare of heavy slaughter pigs  during transport and lairage.  DOI: 10.2527/jas.2014-7670 	25349357

Obesity is a common and complex health problem, which impacts crucial organs; it  is also considered an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Few studies have analyzed the consequence of obesity in the renal proximal convoluted tubules, which are the major tubules involved in reabsorptive processes. For optimal performance of the kidney, energy is primarily provided by mitochondria.  Melatonin, an indoleamine and antioxidant, has been identified in mitochondria, and there is considerable evidence regarding its essential role in the prevention of oxidative mitochondrial damage. In this study we evaluated the mechanism(s) of mitochondrial alterations in an animal model of obesity (ob/ob mice) and describe the beneficial effects of melatonin treatment on mitochondrial morphology and dynamics as influenced by mitofusin-2 and the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. Melatonin dissolved in 1% ethanol was added to the drinking water from postnatal  week 5-13; the calculated dose of melatonin intake was 100 mg/kg body weight/day. Compared to control mice, obesity-related morphological alterations were apparent in the proximal tubules which contained round mitochondria with irregular, short  cristae and cells with elevated apoptotic index. Melatonin supplementation in obese mice changed mitochondria shape and cristae organization of proximal tubules, enhanced mitofusin-2 expression, which in turn modulated the progression of the mitochondria-driven intrinsic apoptotic pathway. These changes possibly aid in reducing renal failure. The melatonin-mediated changes indicate its potential protective use against renal morphological damage and dysfunction associated with obesity and metabolic disease.

Synergistic effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and marination treatment on the inactivation of hepatitis a virus in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis).

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, via Bianchi 7/9, 25124, Brescia, Italy, enrico.pavoni@izsler.it.  Consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked mussels contaminated with hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a major cause of infection to humans. The origin of mussels commonly used for the preparation of marinated seafood salads is often unknown, since different producers worldwide undergo a precooking treatment at the original collection site with methods and parameters not always indicated. These  treatments could be insufficient for the inactivation of HAV, which is characterized by a high temperature resistance. Both high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and marinade treatments have been shown to affect HAV vitality. In this study, two treatments (HHP and marinating) were combined in order to assess a potential synergistic effect on the virus vitality. A kinetic test was conducted  by subjecting the experimentally-contaminated mussels (HAV titre: 10(6)/ml TCID50) to marinating, and to different HHP treatment (4,000; 5,000; and 6,000 bar for 1, 5, and 9 min). Virus post-treatment vitality was assessed by its ability to grow on cell cultures and by quantitative real-time RT-PCR to evaluate virus resistance under such conditions. Marinating treatment alone (final pH 4.3, and NaCl 2 %) did not inactivate the virus. On the other hand, the use of HHP treatment alone on non-marinated HAV-contaminated mussels was effective only above 5,000 bar for 5 min. The results of the present study elucidate the synergistic effect of a combination between marination and HHP treatments on the  inactivation of the virus.  DOI: 10.1007/s12560-014-9167-z 	25344058

Despite the fact that its use as a growth promoter has been banned in the European Union (EU) since 1981, its detection in bovine urine, in the form of α-boldenone conjugate, is considered fully compliant up to 2 ng mL(-1). The conjugated form of β-boldenone must be absent. In recent years, the literature about boldenone has focused on the identification of biomarkers that can indicate an illicit treatment. β-boldenone sulfate is a candidate molecule, even if the only studies currently available have taken place in small populations. In this study, a method for the determination of sulfate and glucuronate conjugates of β-boldenone was developed and validated according to the European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and applied to α-boldenone sulfate and glucuronide, α- and β-boldenone free forms and androstadienedione (ADD), too. The clean-up with immunoaffinity columns enabled the direct determination of the  conjugates and free forms and allowed specific and sensitive analyses of urine samples randomly selected to verify this method. The decision limits (CCα) ranged between 0.07 and 0.08 ng mL(-1), the detection capabilities (CCβ) between 0.08 and 0.1 ng mL(-1). Recovery was higher than 92% for all the analytes. Intra-day repeatability was between 5.8% and 17.2%, and inter-day repeatability was between 6.0% and 21.8% for the studied free and conjugated forms. This method has been developed as a powerful tool with the aim to study the origin of boldenone in a trial on a significant number of animals.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 are the most prevalent subtypes in swine in Italy. Reassortant influenza A viruses subtypes in swine appeared in European pig population. In particular reassortant viruses carrying genome segment from the pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) are reported in many European countries, including Italy. In a 1000 sows farrow-to feeder farm, in Northern Italy, we isolated 10 IAVs from recurrent episodes of respiratory disease in 45-70 days-old pigs from September 2012 to June 2013. The antigenic and genetic characterization of the swine IAV isolates showed the contemporary circulation of H1N1 avian-like and H1N1pdm strains in the first outbreak. The analysis of the viruses isolated subsequently showed the circulation of H1N1pdm IAV and then the  establishment of a new previously undescribed H1N1 reassortant strain with a pandemic derived hemagglutinin gene and all the other seven segments of swine H1N1 avian-like lineage.

The objective of this study was to analyse over time the evolution of E. coli O157:H7 faecal shedding in a dairy herd producing raw milk for direct human consumption. The study was performed between October 2012 and September 2013 in an average size Italian dairy farm where animals are housed inside the barn all over the year. The farm housed about 140 animals during the study - 70 cows and 70 calves and heifers. Twenty-six animals were randomly selected from both the cows and young animals group, and faecal sampling was performed rectally six times two months apart in each animal. Eleven animals were culled during the study and a total of 285 faecal samples were collected. At each faecal sampling,  three trough water samples and two trough feed samples were also collected for a  total of 36 water samples and 24 feed samples. Samples were analysed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and culture. Overall, 16 (5.6%) faecal samples were positive for E. coli O157 by RT-PCR. Cultural examination found 9 (3.1%) samples positive for E. coli O157; all the isolates were positive for stx1, stx 2 and eae genes. One (4.1%) feed sample was positive for E. coli O157 by RT-PCR; none of the water samples was positive for E. coli O157. The model highlighted a  general significant reduction of the number of positive samples observed during the study from the first to the sixth sampling (P=0.000) and a positive relation  between the presence of positive samples and average environmental temperature (P=0.003). The results of the study showed that in an Italian dairy farm housing  animals all year, faecal shedding of E. coli O157 followed the same temporal trend reported for other types of farming. The enhanced faecal shedding during warmer months may have a significant impact on environmental contamination and the safety of raw milk and its byproducts.

A simple and reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of aflatoxin B₁ in feed.  Biancardi A(1), Dall'Asta C.  Author information:  (1)a Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna  , Brescia , Italy.  A chromatographic method is proposed for the analysis of aflatoxin B1 in cereal-based feed, particularly targeted to dairy animals. The method is based on a solid-liquid extraction followed by a Mycosep 226 clean-up. Accuracy and precision were established at the LOQ (1 µg kg⁻¹) with a spiked sample as well as with two other different naturally contaminated reference materials. The mean overall recovery (n = 18) was 100.8%, with a confidence interval of 2.7% and a CV% of 5.5%. The performance of the proposed method was compared with the AOAC method based on the use of immunoaffinity chromatography columns, proving that it could be considered a valid alternative. Moreover, the sample preparation is very simple and straightforward, potentially being applicable as a high-throughput method. On account of its simplicity and low cost, the method may be applied to the analysis of a large number of samples in the occasion of outbreaks of large-scale contamination.

European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV) is the aetiological agent of European  brown hare syndrome (EBHS), a disease affecting Lepus europaeus and Lepus timidus first diagnosed in Sweden in 1980. To characterize EBHSV evolution we studied hare samples collected in Sweden between 1982 and 2008. Our molecular clock dating is compatible with EBHSV emergence in the 1970s. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two lineages: Group A persisted until 1989 when it apparently suffered extinction; Group B emerged in the mid-1980s and contains the most recent strains. Antigenic differences exist between groups, with loss of reactivity of some MAbs over time, which are associated with amino acid substitutions in recognized epitopes. A role for immune selection is also supported by the presence of positively selected codons in exposed regions of the capsid. Hence, EBHSV evolution is characterized by replacement of Group A by Group B viruses, suggesting that the latter possess a selective advantage.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Notably, M. bovis exhibits a wide host range; the infection has been reported in many domesticated animals and free or captive wildlife. Despite most of them acting as spill-over hosts in particular epidemiological scenarios, some domesticated species as pigs, camelids and goats may display high rates of infection and possibly play a role in the inter-species transmission of the disease. The aim of this review is to make an updated overview of the susceptibility and the role in  the transmission of the disease of the most common domesticated animals species such as small ruminants, pigs, horses, camelids, dogs and cats. An overview of the diagnostic approaches to detect the infection in each of the species included in the review is also presented.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bovine udder infections induce a variety of changes in gene expression of different growth factors that may suggest their possible role in glandular tissue protection or repair processes. Growth factors and also chemokines and cytokines  may act synergistically to increase the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages to promote angiogenesis, fibroplasia, matrix deposition, and, ultimately, re-epithelialization. Considering the vast applications, typically in human medicine, of platelet concentrate (PC) and its ease of preparation, the aim of our study was to evaluate an alternative therapy to stimulate the regeneration of glandular tissue, administering a concentration in excess of the growth factors contained in the PC. In each one of the 3 farms examined in the trial, PC was prepared from donor cows in good health, free from infections, and with no records of medications administered during the previous 2 mo. The platelet produced in one farm was used only for treating the cows of the same farm in a heterologous way. A total of 229 mastitic quarters were divided in 3 groups: antibiotic group (treated with intramammary antibiotic), antibiotic and PC group  (treated intramammarily with antibiotics in association with PC), and PC group (treated with intramammary PC alone). The diagnosis of mastitis was based on somatic cell count and bacteriological evaluation of the milk from the affected quarter. Platelet concentrate, alone or in association with antibiotic, was used  for 3 consecutive days as an unconventional therapy in bovine acute and chronic mastitis. Our data show that the associated action of antibiotic and PC performed significantly better than the antibiotic alone, either for the recovery of the affected mammary quarters or for somatic cell count reduction. In the same way, the association antibiotic plus PC showed significantly fewer relapses compared with the antibiotic alone, either for acute or chronic mastitis. The treatment with only PC did not show statistically significant differences compared with both antibiotic alone or associated treatment for acute mastitis, and it was better than the use of only antibiotic for chronic mastitis. Our results show that PC alone may be useful for a quick resolution of the inflammatory response,  playing a role in limiting the tissue damage to the mammary gland parenchyma and  reducing the recurrence rates.

Chlamydia (C.) pecorum, an obligate intracellular bacterium, may cause severe diseases in ruminants, swine and koalas, although asymptomatic infections are the norm. Recently, we identified genetic polymorphisms in the ompA, incA and ORF663  genes that potentially differentiate between high-virulence C. pecorum isolates from diseased animals and low-virulence isolates from asymptomatic animals. Here, we expand these findings by including additional ruminant, swine, and koala strains. Coding tandem repeats (CTRs) at the incA locus encoded a variable number of repeats of APA or AGA amino acid motifs. Addition of any non-APA/AGA repeat motif, such as APEVPA, APAVPA, APE, or APAPE, associated with low virulence (P<10-4), as did a high number of amino acids in all incA CTRs (P = 0.0028). In ORF663, high numbers of 15-mer CTRs correlated with low virulence (P = 0.0001). Correction for ompA phylogram position in ORF663 and incA abolished the correlation between genetic changes and virulence, demonstrating co-evolution of  ompA, incA, and ORF663 towards low virulence. Pairwise divergence of ompA, incA,  and ORF663 among isolates from healthy animals was significantly higher than among strains isolated from diseased animals (P≤10-5), confirming the longer evolutionary path traversed by low-virulence strains. All three markers combined  identified 43 unique strains and 4 pairs of identical strains among all 57 isolates tested, demonstrating the suitability of these markers for epidemiological investigations.

Genetic typing of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) has distinguished BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 species and an emerging putative third species (HoBi-like virus), recently detected in southern Italy, signaling the occurrence of natural infection in Europe. Recognizing the need to update the data on BVDV genetic variability in Italy for mounting local and European alerts, a wide collection of 5' UTR sequences (n = 371) was selected to identify the frequency of genotypes and subtypes at the herd level. BVDV-1 had the highest frequency, followed by sporadic BVDV-2. No novel HoBi-like viruses were identified. Four distribution patterns of BVDV-1 subtypes were observed: highly prevalent subtypes with a wide  temporal-spatial distribution (1b and 1e), low prevalent subtypes with a widespread geographic distribution (1a, 1d, 1g, 1h, and 1k) or a restricted geographic distribution (1f), and sporadic subtypes detected only in single herds (1c, 1j, and 1l). BVDV-1c, k, and l are reported for the first time in Italy. A unique genetic variant was detected in the majority of herds, but cocirculation of genetic variants was also observed. Northern Italy ranked first for BVDV introduction, prevalence, and dispersion. Nevertheless, the presence of sporadic  variants in other restricted areas suggests the risk of different routes of BVDV  introduction.  DOI: 10.1155/2014/147145  PMCID: PMC4090534	25045658

Campylobacter jejuni is the most common food-borne zoonotic pathogen causing human gastroenteritis worldwide and has assumed more importance in Italy following the increased consumption of raw milk. Our objectives were to get an overview of genotypes and antibiotic resistances in C. jejuni isolated from milk, cattle feces, and pigeons in dairy herds of Northern Italy. flaB-typing was applied to 78 C. jejuni isolates, previously characterized by Multi-Locus Sequence Typing, and genotypic resistances towards macrolides and quinolones based on point mutations in the 23S rRNA and gyrA genes, respectively, were determined. flaB-typing revealed 22 different types with one of them being novel  and was useful to further differentiate strains with an identical Sequence Type (ST) and to identify a pigeon-specific clone. Macrolide resistance was not found, while quinolone resistance was detected in 23.3% of isolates. A relationship between specific genotypes and antibiotic resistance was observed, but was only significant for the Clonal Complex 206. Our data confirm that pigeons do not play a role in the spread of C. jejuni among cattle and they are not responsible for milk contamination. A relevant number of bulk milk samples were contaminated by C. jejuni resistant to quinolones, representing a possible source of human resistant strains.

Following the emergence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 in humans, this novel influenza virus was reverse transmitted from infected people to swine population worldwide. In this study we investigated the molecular evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus identified in pigs reared in a single herd. Nasal swabs taken from pigs showing respiratory distress were tested for influenza type A and A(H1N1)pdm09 by real-time RT-PCR assays. Virus isolation from positive samples was attempted by inoculation of nasal swabs samples into specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) and complete genome sequencing was performed on virus strains  after replication on ECE or from original swab sample. The molecular analysis of  hemagglutinin (HA) showed, in four of the swine influenza viruses under study, a  unique significant amino acid change, represented by a two-amino acid insertion at the HA receptor binding site. Phylogenetic analysis of HA, neuraminidase, and  concatenated internal genes revealed a very similar topology, with viruses under  study forming a separate cluster, branching outside the A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates recognized until 2014. The emergence of this new cluster of A(H1N1)pdm09 in swine raises further concerns about whether A(H1N1)pdm09 with new molecular characteristics will become established in pigs and potentially transmitted to humans.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a RNA non-enveloped virus that comprises four genotypes. The genome of HEV is organized into three Open Reading Frames (ORFs),  and the ORF2 is responsible for encoding capsid proteins. HEV can infect a wide range of hosts, and pigs are considered the main reservoir. HEV infection is considered a zoonosis and it is responsible for acute hepatitis in humans, especially in developing countries. The development of a blocking ELISA would be  of high value for screening purpose, because there is no need of species specific reagents. The present study was conducted to assess three in-house ELISAs for the detection of HEV infection in 779 sera collected from breeding and fattening farms under field conditions. Two assays were indirect ELISAs, while the third was a blocking ELISA. Two different recombinant antigens were generated from specific sequences of the HEV-ORF2, and a Latent Class approach in a Bayesian framework was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each ELISA. Because the three ELISAs cannot be thought of as independent, all possible dependence structures were modelled starting from the general case of conditional independence to the most complex situation of three mutually dependent assays. Results showed that none of the three ELISAs was significantly superior to the others in terms of sensitivity (posterior median value ranging from 89% to 94%, all 95% posterior credible intervals (95%PCI) overlapped). In terms of specificity, one of the indirect ELISAs was superior to blocking ELISA (posterior median indirect ELISA: 99%, 95%PCI: 98-100%; blocking ELISA: 90%; 95%PCI: 86-94%). However, this difference could be due to the potential wider spectrum of antibodies that blocking ELISA can actually detect.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cisplatin (CisPt) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug whose side effects include muscle weakness and cachexia. Here we analysed CisPt-induced atrophy in C2C12 myotubes by a multidisciplinary morphological approach, focusing on the onset and progression of autophagy, a protective cellular process that, when excessively activated, may trigger protein hypercatabolism and atrophy in skeletal muscle. To visualize autophagy we used confocal and transmission electron microscopy at different times of treatment and doses of CisPt. Moreover  we evaluated the effects of taurine, a cytoprotective beta-amino acid able to counteract oxidative stress, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in different tissues and organs. Our microscopic results indicate that autophagy occurs very early in 50  μM CisPt challenged myotubes (4 h-8 h) before overt atrophy but it persists even at 24 h, when several autophagic vesicles, damaged mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic blebbings engulf the sarcoplasm. Differently, 25 mM taurine pretreatment rescues the majority of myotubes size upon 50  μM CisPt at 24 h. Taurine appears to counteract atrophy by restoring regular microtubular apparatus and mitochondria and reducing the overload and the localization of autophagolysosomes. Such a promising taurine action in preventing atrophy needs further molecular and biochemical studies to best define its impact on muscle homeostasis and the maintenance of an adequate skeletal mass in vivo.

Electronic address: massimo.amadori@izsler.it.  Oral, low-dose IFN-α treatments proved effective in several models of viral infections and immunopathological conditions. Also, they do not give rise to the  serious side effects observed after parenteral inoculation of high doses (10(5)U/kg b.w. and higher). There is convincing evidence that such treatments work through an early, effective interaction with oral lymphoid tissues before the IFN-α molecules are rapidly destroyed by gut enzymes. Yet, the paucity of detailed information about these crucial interactions and the lack of recognized  in vitro models hamper the development of proper administration protocols. On the basis of a previous study, we developed an in vitro model of interaction between  different types of human and porcine IFNs-α at low/moderate concentrations and pig tonsil cells. The IFNs-α under study showed different properties with respect to three fundamental control actions: (1) IgA release in culture, (2) release of  natural antimicrobial compounds, and (3) homeostatic regulation of the inflammatory response. This was checked in pig intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cell line) treated with supernatants of control and IFN α-treated tonsil cell cultures, respectively, in terms of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses. Some IFNs-α caused a significant inhibition of IL-8 (protein release and gene expression) and beta-defensin 1 (gene expression) probably through second messengers released by IFN α-treated tonsil cells. Interestingly, a human  lymphoblastoid IFN-α under study caused the decrease of polyclonal IgA release by pig tonsil cells and significantly stimulated the in vitro recall antibody response of swine PBMC to Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus. The modulation of IgA and antibacterial compounds was accompanied by an anti-inflammatory control action at the same, low to moderate IFN-α concentrations (1-100 U/ml). This highlights the  very foundation of the homeostatic control actions performed by Type I IFNs: to promote an effective host response to infectious and non-infectious stressors and to turn off noxious inflammatory responses associated with tissue damage and waste of metabolic energy. The described tonsil cell model in vitro can be conducive to a further development of oral cytokine treatments in humans and animals in the "one health" conceptual framework.

In order to simulate a contamination at the processing plant, one batch of freshly-processed salami batter (20 kg) was inoculated (1% v:w) with 5 log colony forming unit (CFU)/g of a multi-strain cocktail of two strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (registered and wild strain). Another batch was inoculated (1% v:w)  with sterile physiological saline solution and used to check the lactic acid bacteria (Lab) behaviour and the changes of physicochemical parameters (pH and aw ). Both batches were then processed to obtain a semi-dry salami (Hungarian-style): microbiological and physico-chemical properties were monitored during 94 days of ripening. During the manufacturing process, the levels of pathogen decreased of about 2.18 log CFU/g with respect to the initial inoculated levels. The behaviour of the indigenous bacteria such as Lab and the physico-chemical properties can help to determine the fate of pathogens throughout processing.

Electronic address: paolo.pasquali@iss.it.  A major cause of salmonellosis in humans is the contamination of pork products. Infection in pigs can be controlled using bio-security programs, but they are not sufficient in countries where a high level of infection is recorded. In this context, the use of vaccines can represent a valid supplementary method of control. Recently, we have demonstrated that an attenuated strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium ΔznuABC) is protective against systemic and enteric salmonellosis in mouse and pig infection models, candidating this strain as an oral attenuated vaccine. In this study, we compared the efficacy of this attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium strain when administered orally or parenterally. Furthermore, in order to reproduce a pseudo-natural infection model, vaccinated pigs were allocated in the same pen with animals shedding virulent Salmonella Typhimurium. Animals were monitored weekly after vaccination and contact with infected piglets. Diarrhea and ataxia were recorded  and Salmonella shedding was tested individually through bacterial culture. After  four weeks of cohousing, piglets were euthanized, after which lymph nodes reactivity and gross lesions of the gut sections were scored at necropsy. Organs  were submitted to microbiological and histological analyses. The data reported herein show that parenterally vaccinated animals do not shed the attenuated strain, and at the same time the absence of symptoms and decrease in virulent strain shedding in feces from day 6 after challenge demonstrated protection against infection induced by virulent Salmonella Typhimurium. In conclusion, our  findings suggest that this is an alternative route of Salmonella Typhimurium ΔznuABC administration, without ignoring the advantages associated with oral vaccination.

Approximately 23,000 hunter-harvested wild boars from the pre-Alpine area of northern Italy were examined for tuberculosis over a 9-year period (2003 to 2011). Retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes from the wild boars were examined grossly, and 1,151 of the lymph nodes were analyzed in our laboratory by histology (728 samples) and culture isolation (819 samples). Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)-specific PCR (1,142 samples) was used for molecular-level detection in tissue samples, as was a gyrB restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay (322 samples). Lesions compatible with tuberculosis and indistinguishable from those described in cases of Mycobacterium bovis infection had been observed since 2003. Mycobacterium microti was identified directly in 256 tissue samples by the adopted molecular approaches. However, only 26 M. microti strains were obtained by culture isolation due to the well-known difficulties in isolating this slow-growing mycobacterium. During 2006, a prevalence study was performed in two provinces of the area, and the diffusion of M. microti was calculated to be 5.8% (95% confidence intervals surrounding the estimated prevalences [CIP95%], 3.94 to 7.68%). Over the following years (2007 to 2011), the presence of M. microti appeared to be stable. All isolates were genotyped by spoligotyping and exact tandem repeat analysis (ETR types A to F). In addition to the typical vole type (SB0118), a new spoligotype lacking the 43 spacers was found. Spoligotyping was also applied directly to tissue samples, and a geographical cluster distribution of the two spoligotypes was observed. This is the first report studying the diffusion and genetic variability of M. microti in wild boar.  Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, National Reference Centre for Paratuberculosis, Gariga, Podenzano (PC), Italy.  The causative agent of paratuberculosis in ruminants, Mycobacterium avium subsp.  paratuberculosis (MAP), although still a matter of debate, has been linked with Crohn's and other human diseases. The availability of rapid methods for assessing the viability of MAP cells in food, in particular milk, could be of great use for risk management in food safety. MAP viability is generally assessed using culture techniques that require prolonged incubation periods for the growth of MAP. To differentiate between viable and nonviable MAP cells in milk samples, this study  explores the combination of two already described techniques: peptide magnetic bead separation followed by Propidium Monoazide qPCR. Using an Ordinal Multinomial Logistic Regression model to analyze the results obtained after spiking milk samples with mixtures containing different percentages of viable/dead cells, we were able to assess the probability of the viability status of MAP found in milk. This model was applied to contaminated pasteurized milk to  ascertain the efficacy of heat treatment in MAP killing. The method reported herein can potentially be used for direct detection of MAP viability in milk.  © 2014 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by John Wiley  & Sons Ltd.

Group A rotaviruses (RVA) cause acute dehydrating diarrhea in young of man and many animal species, including pigs. Swine RVA has an important economic impact on the farming industry, and pigs represent a potential reservoir for zoonotic transmission of RVA to humans. To investigate the genetic diversity of porcine RVA strains in Italy and identify their possible zoonotic characteristics, 25 RVA-positive feces were collected from diarrheic pigs in Northern Italy, in 2009-2010; all viral strains were characterized by G and P genotyping RT-PCR. Three samples were selected for full genome sequencing. Sequencing of the NSP3 genes of all samples was also performed. Rotavirus diagnosis was carried out by ELISA and electron microscopy. RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed in a one-tube format, using primer sets specific for each of the 11 genome segments. Analysis of the G (VP7) and P (VP4) genotypes showed that all strains identified  were typical porcine RVAs (G4, G5, G9; P[6], P[13], P[23]). Full-length genome sequencing was performed on selected G9 isolates. Most segments belonged to the genotype constellation 1 (Wa-like), which is shared by most human RVA strains, but gene types such as I5 (VP6) and A8 (NSP1), which are typical of porcine and rare among human RVAs, were also detected. We identified RVA strains showing the  T7 genotype, an NSP3 gene type that was previously reported in unusual strains of possible porcine or bovine origin from children with diarrhea. Recent reports suggested that G9 RVA may have been introduced from swine to human populations involving gene reassortment events. The observation that some of the RVA genotypes from swine in Italy were similar to viruses characterized in children underlines the importance of animal RVA surveillance, to clarify and monitor the  role of animals as genetic reservoirs of emerging RVA strains pathogenic for humans.

We investigated the circulation dynamics of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) reservoir in Italy. In particular, we evaluated the temporal distribution of virologic findings by combining virus isolation data with a new population genetic-based study approach. Thus, during 11 consecutive sampling periods (wintering periods between 1993/94 and 2003/04), categorised into 40 sampling sub-periods, cloacal swab samples were collected from 996 wild and 16 captive-reared mallards, to be screened by RT-PCR before attempting influenza A virus isolation in embryonated eggs. Forty-eight LPAIVs were isolated from wild mallards and antigenically characterised by haemagglutination-inhibition and neuraminidase-inhibition assays. When considering LPAIV antigenic subtypes in which more than one mallard  tested virus isolation positive (H1N1, n. 22; H2N3, n. 2; H5N3, n. 2; H6N5, n. 3; H6N8, n. 2; H7N3, n. 3; H11N6, n. 5), at least two birds infected with a specific HN subtype clustered within one same sampling sub-period. In the context of the novel population genetic approach, total DNA was extracted from a subset of 16 captive-reared and 65 wild ducks (2000/01 and 2001/02 sampling periods) to assess genetic diversity by amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) markers. Analyses of AFLP results showed that captive-reared mallards clustered together,  whereas two main independent clusters characterised the distribution pattern of most wild mallards. Within this subset of samples, nearly identical H7N3 LPAIV strains were isolated from two wild mallards belonging to the same genetic cluster. Blood sera were also collected from the above subset of mallards and examined for antibodies to the homologous H7N3 virus strain. Four out of six wild mallards testing H7N3-seropositive by haemagglutination-inhibition assay (2001/02 period) belonged to the genetic cluster including H7N3 virus shedding ducks. Overall, our data raise the possibility of an enhanced transmission and circulation of LPAIVs in genetic or social groups of wild mallards, gathered in flocks possibly related by parentage and/or geographic origin.

Members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) cause a serious disease  with similar pathology, tuberculosis; in this review, bovine tuberculosis will be considered as disease caused by any member of the MTBC in bovids. Bovine tuberculosis is responsible for significant economic loss due to costly eradication programs and trade limitations and poses a threat to both endangered  and protected species as well as to public health. We here give an overview on all members of the MTBC, focusing on their isolation from different animal hosts. We also review the recent advances made in elucidating the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships of members of the MTBC. Because the nomenclature of the MTBC is controversial, its members have been considered species, subspecies or ecotypes, this review discusses the possible implications for diagnostics and  the legal consequences of naming of new species.

Tonsils from 150 pigs slaughtered at 270 days or older were tested for Yersinia enterocolitica with different cultural methods. Samples were collected in three different abattoirs of Northern Italy between April and November 2012 and were analysed by direct plating on cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agar and by enrichment procedures following the ISO 10273:2003 reference method. Twenty-three (15.3%) samples were positive: 22 tonsils (14.7%) were positive for human pathogenic Y. enterocolitica bio-serotype 4/O:3 and one tonsil (0.7%) for Y. enterocolitica bio-serotype 1A/7,8-8,8,19. Seventeen samples out of 23 (73.9%) were positive by direct plating method. Among the enrichment procedures, the best recovery rate (8 positives out of 23; 34.8%) was obtained by the two-day enrichment in peptone-sorbitol-bile (PSB) broth followed by plating on CIN agar plates. The two-day enrichment in PSB followed by potassium hydroxide (KOH) treatment before plating onto CIN agar gave 7 positives out of 23 (30.4%), decreasing to 3 positives (13.0%) without KOH treatment. The worst results were obtained by prolonged (five days) enrichment in PSB, with or without KOH treatment, followed by plating on CIN agar: 4.3% (1 out of 23) and 0.0% recovery  rates, respectively. The mean concentration was 1.9 × 10(4)CFU/g, with a minimum  of 1.0 × 10(2)CFU/g and a maximum of 5.8 × 10(4)CFU/g, thus demonstrating that tonsils may play an important role in contamination of pluck sets, carcasses, and slaughterhouse environment. Prevalence of virulence genes among the Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates was as follows: 12/22 (54.5%) for yadA, 21/22 (95.5%) for ail, 21/22 (95.5%) for inv and 22/22 (100%) for ystA. All Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime and resistant to ampicillin and cephalotin. High proportions of 4/O:3 isolates (95%) were sensitive to cefotaxime, gentamicin, kanamicin and nalidixic acid. High levels of resistance were observed to sulphonamide compounds (91%), streptomycin (64%) and chloramphenicol (55%). Multi-resistant isolates were very common; resistance to three or more antimicrobials was observed in 91% (20/22) of 4/O:3 isolates. High level of resistance to chloramphenicol was possibly due to coresistance to tiamphenicol, which was detected in 100% of the isolates. XbaI-PFGE detected four clusters among the 22 Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates. The most represented accounted for 77% (17/22) of the isolates, the second most common was found in 14% (3/22) of the isolates and the two other profiles were observed in single isolates. The comparison with a selection of human isolates supported the role of the pig as reservoir of 4/O:3 Y. enterocolitica.  Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

According to EC Regulation No 2073/2005, for food business operators that produce ready-to-eat (RTE) product, it is crucial to be able to demonstrate if the product supports the growth of Listeria monocytogenes. The objective of the study was therefore to evaluate the behaviour of L. monocytogenes in sliced RTE turkey  bresaola (made by cured turkey breast 4.5% NaCl, 1% sodium lactate, sodium nitrite 150 ppm and flavouring) during the shelf life of the product, simulating  a contamination during the slicing operation. Considering a shelf life of 90 days, as defined by manufacturer, the packages of sliced bresaola were stored at  5°C for 7 days and at 8°C for the remaining storage time (83 days). L. monocytogenes count decreased during storage test from 1.43/1.98 log cfu/g in the three batches tested to 1.03 log cfu/g in one batch and to undetectable levels in the other two batches. The results show that the investigated product is unable to support the growth of L. monocytogenes.  DOI: 10.4081/ijfs.2014.2231  PMCID: PMC5076673	27800323

In the last years, consequently to EC Regulation no. 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods, some Italian food businnes operators (FBOs) leaders  in the meat sector, invested in research to develop innovative products such as low fat salami, containing up to 30% less fat than the traditional one. For FBOs  it is essential to demonstrate for each production process whether the substrate  allows the growth of L. monocytogenes and whether L. monocytogenes could reach or exceed the limit of 100 cfu g-1 at the end of the shelf life, as stated by EC Regulation no. 2073/2005. In the present study, the growth potential of L. monocytogenes during the shelf life of low fat salami packed in modified atmosphere was evaluated. The results show that the product is unable to support  the growth of pathogen, even if the storage temperature is between 8 and 12°C.  DOI: 10.4081/ijfs.2014.2112  PMCID: PMC5076671	27800321

The classical microbiological method for detection of Salmonella spp. requires more than five days for final confirmation, and consequently there is a need for  an alternative methodology for detection of this pathogen particularly in those food categories with a short shelf-life. This study presents an international (at European level) ISO 16140-based validation study of a non-proprietary Real-Time PCR-based method that can generate final results the day following sample analysis. It is based on an ISO compatible enrichment coupled to an easy and inexpensive DNA extraction and a consolidated Real-Time PCR assay. Thirteen laboratories from seven European Countries participated to this trial, and pork meat was selected as food model. The limit of detection observed was down to 10 CFU per 25 g of sample, showing excellent concordance and accordance values between samples and laboratories (100%). In addition, excellent values were obtained for relative accuracy, specificity and sensitivity (100%) when the results obtained for the Real-Time PCR-based methods were compared to those of the ISO 6579:2002 standard method. The results of this international trial demonstrate that the evaluated Real-Time PCR-based method represents an excellent alternative to the ISO standard. In fact, it shows an equal and solid performance as well as it reduces dramatically the extent of the analytical process, and can  be easily implemented routinely by the Competent Authorities and Food Industry laboratories.

The need for antibiotic treatments in dairy cattle farms can be reduced by a combined intervention scheme based on: (1) timely clinical inspections, (2) the assessment of animal-based welfare parameters, and (3) the use of predictive laboratory tests. These can provide greater insight into environmental adaptation of dairy cows and define animals at risk of contracting disease. In the long-term, an improved disease control justifies the adoption of such a combined  strategy. Many antibiotic treatments for chronic disease cases are often not justified with a cost/benefit analysis, because the repeated drug administration  does not give rise to the expected outcome in terms of animal health. In particular, compared with untreated cases, antibiotics may not lead to greater cure rates for some forms of mastitis. Lastly, a substantial reduction of antibiotic usage in dairy farms can be achieved through the proper use of immunomodulators, aimed at increasing immunocompetence and disease resistance of  cows.

(2)Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche Veterinarie, Università Bologna , Ozzano dell'Emilia (BO), Italy.  Formagelle di capra is a raw goat cheese produced from whole chilled goat milk; traditional technology involving unpasteurised milk and indigenous lactic starter cultures is employed for its production in Italy. The purpose of this study was to assess the behaviour of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during the manufacturing and  ripening of this raw goat milk cheese. Raw milk was experimentally inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 in a laboratory scale plant and the count was monitored during production and 30 days of ripening required for this cheese. Results showed that E. coli O157:H7 count increased to more than 1.5 Log cfu g-1 during cheese production and remained constant until the end of ripening. The evidence that E. coli O157:H7 is able to survive during the manufacturing and ripening process suggests that the 30-day ripening period alone is insufficient to eliminate levels of viable E. coli O157:H7 in Formaggelle di capra cheese and that the presence of low numbers of E. coli O157:H7 in milk destined for the production of raw goat milk cheeses could represent a potential source of infection for humans and a threat for consumers.

The classical microbiological method for detection of Listeria monocytogenes requires around 7 days for final confirmation, and due to perishable nature of RTE food products, there is a clear need for an alternative methodology for detection of this pathogen. This study presents an international (at European level) ISO 16140-based validation trial of a non-proprietary real-time PCR-based  methodology that can generate final results in the following day of the analysis. This methodology is based on an ISO compatible enrichment coupled to a bacterial  DNA extraction and a consolidated real-time PCR assay. Twelve laboratories from six European countries participated in this trial, and soft cheese was selected as food model since it can represent a difficult matrix for the bacterial DNA extraction and real-time PCR amplification. The limit of detection observed was down to 10 CFU per 25 of sample, showing excellent concordance and accordance values between samples and laboratories (>75%). In addition, excellent values were obtained for relative accuracy, specificity and sensitivity (82.75%, 96.70%  and 97.62%, respectively) when the results obtained for the real-time PCR-based methods were compared to those of the ISO 11290-1 standard method. An interesting observation was that the L. monocytogenes detection by the real-time PCR method was less affected in the presence of Listeria innocua in the contaminated samples, proving therefore to be more reliable than the reference method. The results of this international trial demonstrate that the evaluated real-time PCR-based method represents an excellent alterative to the ISO standard since it  shows a higher performance as well as reduce the extent of the analytical process, and can be easily implemented routinely by the competent authorities and food industry laboratories.

Italy has experienced recurrent incursions of H5N2 avian influenza (AI) viruses in different geographical areas and varying sectors of the domestic poultry industry. Considering outbreak heterogeneity rather than treating all outbreaks of low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) viruses equally is important given their interactions with the environment and potential to spread, evolve and increase pathogenicity. This study aims at identifying potential environmental drivers of  H5N2 LPAI outbreak occurrence in time, space and poultry populations. Thirty-four environmental variables were tested for association with the characteristics of 27 H5N2 LPAI outbreaks (i.e. time, place, flock type, number and species of birds affected) occurred among domestic poultry flocks in Italy in 2010-2012. This was  done by applying a recently proposed analytical approach based on a combined non-metric multidimensional scaling, clustering and regression analysis. Results  indicated that the pattern of (dis)similarities among the outbreaks entailed an underlying structure that may be the outcome of large-scale, environmental interactions in ecological dimension. Increased densities of poultry breeders, and increased land coverage by industrial, commercial and transport units were associated with increased heterogeneity in outbreak characteristics. In areas with high breeder densities and with many infrastructures, outbreaks affected mainly industrial turkey/layer flocks. Outbreaks affecting ornamental, commercial and rural multi-species flocks occurred mainly in lowly infrastructured areas of  northern Italy. Outbreaks affecting rural layer flocks occurred mainly in areas with low breeder densities in south-central Italy. In savannah-like environments, outbreaks affected mainly commercial flocks of galliformes. Suggestive evidence that ecological ordination makes sense genetically was also provided, as virus strains showing high genetic similarity clustered into ecologically similar outbreaks. Findings were informed by hypotheses about how ecological interactions among poultry populations, viruses and their environments can be related to the observed patterns of H5N2 LPAI occurrence. This may prove useful in enhancing future interventions by developing site-specific, ecologically-grounded strategies.  DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0086788  PMCID: PMC3899360	24466241

Comment in     Vet J. 2014 Jun;200(3):347-8.  The family Chlamydiaceae with the recombined single genus Chlamydia currently comprises nine species, all of which are obligate intracellular organisms distinguished by a unique biphasic developmental cycle. Anecdotal evidence from epidemiological surveys in flocks of poultry, pigeons and psittacine birds have indicated the presence of non-classified chlamydial strains, some of which may act as pathogens. In the present study, phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA and ompA genes, as well as multi-locus sequence analysis of 11 field isolates were conducted. All independent analyses assigned the strains into two different  clades of monophyletic origin corresponding to pigeon and psittacine strains or poultry isolates, respectively. Comparative genome analysis involving the type strains of currently accepted Chlamydiaceae species and the designated type strains representing the two new clades confirmed that the latter could be classified into two different species as their average nucleotide identity (ANI)  values were always below 94%, both with the closest relative species and between  themselves. In view of the evidence obtained from the analyses, we propose the addition of two new species to the current classification: Chlamydia avium sp. nov. comprising strains from pigeons and psittacine birds (type strain 10DC88(T); DSMZ: DSM27005(T), CSUR: P3508(T)) and Chlamydia gallinacea sp. nov. comprising strains from poultry (type strain 08-1274/3(T); DSMZ: DSM27451(T), CSUR: P3509(T)).

INTRODUCTION: Avian influenza viruses circulate in bird populations, and it is important to maintain and uphold our knowledge of the viral strains that are currently of interest in this context. Here, we describe the use of hemagglutinin-pseudotype retroviruses based on highly pathogenic influenza viruses for the screening of avian sera for influenza A antibodies. Our aim was also to determine whether the pseudovirus neutralization tests that we assessed were sensitive and simple to use compared to the traditional methods, including hemagglutination inhibition assays and microneutralization tests. MATERIAL AND METHODS: H5 and H7 pseudovirus neutralization tests were evaluated by using serum from infected rabbits. Subsequently, the assays were further investigated using a panel of serum samples from avian species. The panel contained samples that were seropositive for five different hemagglutinin subtypes as well as influenza A seronegative samples. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the pseudovirus neutralization test is an alternative to hemagglutination inhibition assays, as we observed comparable titers to those of both standard microneutralizations assays as well as hemagglutinin inhibition assays. When evaluated by a panel of avian sera, the  method also showed its capability to recognize antibodies directed toward low-pathogenic H5 and H7. Hence, we conclude that it is possible to use pseudoviruses based on highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses to screen avian  sera for antibodies directed against influenza A subtypes H5 and H7.

Prevalence in bulk tank milk and epidemiology of Campylobacter jejuni in dairy herds in Northern Italy.  Bianchini V(1), Borella L, Benedetti V, Parisi A, Miccolupo A, Santoro E, Recordati C, Luini M.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Lodi, Italy.  Thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. are frequently the cause of human gastroenteritis and have assumed more importance in Italy following the increased consumption of raw milk. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence and genotypes of Campylobacter spp. in dairy herds and to investigate the possible sources of bulk milk contamination. Bulk milk from dairy herds (n = 282) was cultured for Campylobacter spp. and Enterobacteriaceae. At three Campylobacter jejuni-positive farms, bovine feces, pigeon intestines, milk, and water points were also investigated. Isolates were identified by PCR and genotyped using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). C. jejuni was detected in 34 (12%) bulk milk samples. The strains belonged to 14 sequence types, and the most common clonal complexes were CC-21, CC-48, and CC-403. No association was demonstrated between  the presence of C. jejuni and high levels of Enterobacteriaceae in bulk milk. At  the three farms examined, C. jejuni was isolated from bovine feces (25/82 [30.5%]), pigeon intestines (13/60 [21.7%]), bulk milk (10/24 [41.7%]), and water points (4/16 [25%]). MLST revealed lineages that were common between milk and bovine feces but distinct between cattle and pigeons. In one herd, C. jejuni with the same genotype was isolated repeatedly from bulk milk and a cow with an udder  infection. Our results showed a high prevalence of C. jejuni in bulk milk and suggested that udder excretion, in addition to fecal matter, may be a route of bulk milk contamination. MLST analysis indicated that pigeons are probably not relevant for the transmission of C. jejuni to cattle and for milk contamination.  DOI: 10.1128/AEM.03784-13  PMCID: PMC3957646	24413598

Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna , Brescia , Italy.  Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an elusive model of host/virus relationship in which disease is determined by virus pathogenicity, pig breed susceptibility and phenotype, microbial infectious pressure, and environmental conditions. The disease can be controlled by farm management programs, which can be supported by vaccination or conditioning of animals to circulating PRRS virus (PRRSV) strains. Yet, PRRS still represents a cause of heavy losses for the pig industry worldwide. Immunological control strategies are often compounded by poor and late development of adaptive immunity in both vaccinated and infected animals. Also, there is evidence that results of field trials can be worse than those of experimental studies in isolation facilities. Neutralizing antibody (NA) was shown to prevent PRRSV infection. Instead, the role of NA and adaptive immunity on the whole in virus clearance after established PRRSV infections is still contentious. Pigs eventually eliminate PRRSV infection, which may be correlated with an "educated," innate immune response, which may also develop following vaccination. In addition to vaccination, an immunomodulation strategy for PRRS can be reasonably advocated in pig "problem" farms, where a substantial control of disease prevalence and disease-related losses is badly needed. This is not at odds with vaccination, which should be preferably restricted to PRRSV-free animals bound for PRRSV-infected farm units. Oral, low-dose, interferon-α treatments proved effective on farm for the control of respiratory and reproductive disease outbreaks, whereas the results were less clear in isolation facilities. Having in mind the crucial interaction between PRRSV and bacterial lipopolysaccharides for  occurrence of respiratory disease, the strong control actions of low-dose type I  interferons on the inflammatory response observed in vitro and in vivo probably underlie the rapid clinical responses observed in field trials.

Previous studies had indicated an active role of bovine forestomachs in the response to alimentary disorders as well as to inflammatory and infectious processes in both the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and elsewhere. We investigated the potential of bovine forestomachs to receive, elaborate and produce signals and mediators of the innate immune response. Indeed, we detected the expression of Toll IL-1R8/single Ig IL-1-related receptor (TIR8/SIGIRR) and other receptors  and cytokines, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10 and  Caspase-1 in the forestomach walls of healthy cows. Their presence suggests an active role of forestomachs in inflammatory disorders of the GI tract and other body compartments. Moreover, interferon (IFN)-γ was revealed in ruminal content.  We confirmed and further characterized the presence of leukocytes in the rumen fluids. In particular, T-, B-lymphocytes and myeloid lineage cells were detected  in the ruminal content of both rumen-fistulated heifers and diseased cows. An acidogenic diet based on daily supplements of maize was shown to inhibit leukocyte accumulation, as opposed to a control, hay-based diet, with or without  a soy flour (protein) supplement. On the whole, results indicate that bovine forestomachs can receive and elaborate signals for the immune cells infiltrating  the rumen content or other organs. Forestomachs can thus participate in a cross-talk with the lymphoid tissues in the oral cavity and promote regulatory actions at both regional and systemic levels; these might include the control of  dry matter intake as a function of fundamental metabolic requirements of ruminants.

The systemic and respiratory local immune response induced by the intradermal administration of a commercial inactivated Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae whole-cell vaccine (Porcilis(®) MHYO ID ONCE - MSD AH) in comparison with two commercial vaccines administered via the intramuscular route and a negative control (adjuvant only) was investigated. Forty conventional M. hyopneumoniae-free pigs were randomly assigned to four groups (ten animals each): Group A=intradermal administration of the test vaccine by using the needle-less IDAL(®) vaccinator at a dose of 0.2 ml; Group B=intramuscular administration of a commercially available vaccine (vaccine B); Group C=intramuscular administration of the adjuvant only (2 ml of X-solve adjuvant); Group D=intramuscular administration of a commercially available vaccine (vaccine D). Pigs were vaccinated at 28 days of  age. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples were collected at vaccination (blood only), 4 and 8 weeks post-vaccination. Serum and BAL fluid were tested for the presence of antibodies by ELISA test. Peripheral blood monomorphonuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated to quantify the number of IFN-γ secreting cells by ELISpot. Moreover, cytokine gene expression from the BAL fluid was performed. Total antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae and specific IgG were detected in serum of intradermally and intramuscularly (vaccine B only) vaccinated pigs at 4 and 8 weeks post-vaccination. M. hyopneumoniae specific IgA  were detected in BAL fluid from vaccinated animals (Groups A and B) but not from  controls and animals vaccinated with the bacterin D (p<0.05). Significantly higher gene expression of IL-10 was observed in the BAL fluid at week 8 post-vaccination in the intradermally vaccinated pigs (p<0.05). The results support that the intradermal administration of an adjuvanted bacterin induces both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Moreover, the intramuscularly administered commercial vaccines each had a different ability to stimulate the immune response both systemically and locally.  Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Moreno A(1), Gabanelli E, Sozzi E, Lelli D, Chiapponi C, Ciccozzi M, Zehender G,  Cordioli P.  Author information:  (1)Department of Virology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia  ed Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi, 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. anamaria.morenomartin@izsler.it.  European H1N2 swine influenza viruses (EU H1N2SIVs) arose from multiple reassortment events among human H1N1, human H3N2, and avian influenza viruses. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics of 53 Italian H1N2 strains by comparing them with EU H1N2 SIVs. Hemagglutinin (HA) phylogeny revealed Italian strains fell into four groups: Group A and B (41 strains) had a human H1 similar to EU H1N2SIVs, which probably originated in 1986. However Group B (38 strains) formed  a subgroup that had a two-amino acid deletion at positions 146/147 in HA. Group C (11 strains) contained an avian H1 that probably originated in 1996, and Group D  (1 strain) had an H1 characteristic of the 2009 pandemic strain. Neuraminidase (NA) phylogeny suggested a series of genomic reassortments had occurred. Group A  had an N2 that originated from human H3N2 in the late 1970s. Group B had different human N2 that most likely arose from a reassortment with the more recent human H3N2 virus, which probably occurred in 2000. Group C had an avian-like H1 combined with an N2 gene from one of EU H1N2SIVs, EU H3N2SIVs or Human H3N2. Group D was part of the EU H3N2SIVs clade. Although selection pressure for HA and NA was low, several positively selected sites were identified in both proteins, some of which were antigenic, suggesting selection influenced the evolution of SIV. The data highlight different evolutionary trends between European viruses and currently circulating Italian B strains and show the establishment of reassortant strains involving human viruses in Italian pigs.

Foni E(1), Garbarino C, Chiapponi C, Baioni L, Zanni I, Cordioli P.  Author information:  (1)OIE Reference Laboratory for Swine Influenza, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia ed Emilia Romagna, Parma, Italy.  OBJECTIVES: An epidemiological survey was carried out in order to obtain a better understanding of the role of wild boars in the epidemiology of the influenza virus. DESIGN: The samples were submitted to Real-Time PCR testing for gene M of the swine influenza virus (SIV), and virus isolation was performed from the positive  PCR samples. Genome sequence analysis was performed on the isolates. Additionally, 1,977 boar sera samples were analyzed using ELISA and hemoagglutination inhibition. SETTING: Over recent years, the wild boar population has greatly increased in Italy, including in areas of high-density industrial pig farming, where the influenza virus is widespread. From July to December 2012, wild boar lung samples were collected in the Parma and Piacenza area, in the Emilia Romagna region. SAMPLE: 354 wild boar lung samples were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Wild-boar influenza A virus infection should be studied more broadly in order to obtain a better understanding of the epidemiological role played by this species. RESULTS: Three SIV strains were isolated out of 12 samples that resulted positive using PCR analysis and they were identified as avian-like SIV subtype H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained from isolate A/wild boar/291320/2012 showed that it clustered with recent Italian avian-like H1N1 SIVs isolated from domestic pigs. Sixty-eight sera samples showed a positive titer to the isolate A/wild boar/291320/2012. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SIV actively circulates in the wild boar population in the investigated. area.  © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, Brescia 25124, Italy. davide.lelli@izsler.it.  Bats are natural reservoirs for many mammalian coronaviruses, which have received renewed interest after the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV in humans. This study  describes the identification and molecular characterization of alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses in bats in Italy, from 2010 to 2012. Sixty-nine faecal samples and 126 carcasses were tested using pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in seven faecal samples and nine carcasses. A phylogenetic analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence fragments aided in identifying  two alphacoronaviruses from Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii), three clade 2b betacoronaviruses from lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros), and 10 clade 2c betacoronaviruses from Kuhl's pipistrelle, common noctule (Nyctalus noctula), and Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). This study fills a substantive  gap in the knowledge on bat-CoV ecology in Italy, and extends the current knowledge on clade 2c betacoronaviruses with new sequences obtained from bats that have not been previously described as hosts of these viruses.

Sixteen haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIV) have been described to date. Rapid subtype identification of any AIV is of major interest because of the possible serious consequences for the poultry industry and even public health. Molecular techniques currently allow immediate accurate subtype characterisation prior to virus isolation. In this study, a set of fourteen specific real-time RT-PCR methods were developed and evaluated for AIV HA subtyping (H1-H4, H6-H8, H10-H16), H5 and H9 being excluded on the basis of the current validity of the European Union (EU) recommended specific assays. Specific primers and probes sets for each HA-subtype were designed to hybridise the largest isolates range within each single subtype, considering the Eurasian lineage as a major target. The robustness and general application of the 14 HA-subtype methods were verified by the analysis of 110 AIV isolates belonging to all 16 HA-subtypes, performed in different laboratories. The developed real-time  RT-PCR assays proved to be highly specific and revealed suitable sensitivity, allowing direct HA-subtyping of clinical material. In summary, this study provides for the first time a panel of molecular tests using specific hydrolysis  probes for rapid and complete AIV HA-subtype identification.  Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Bolzoni L(1), Tessoni V, Groppi M, De Leo GA.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via dei Mercati 13, 43100 , Parma, Italy, luca.bolzoni@izsler.it.  We applied optimal control theory to an SI epidemic model to identify optimal culling strategies for diseases management in wildlife. We focused on different forms of the objective function, including linear control, quadratic control, and control with limited amount of resources. Moreover, we identified optimal solutions under different assumptions on disease-free host dynamics, namely: self-regulating logistic growth, Malthusian growth, and the case of negligible demography. We showed that the correct characterization of the disease-free host  growth is crucial for defining optimal disease control strategies. By analytical  investigations of the model with negligible demography, we demonstrated that the  optimal strategy for the linear control can be either to cull at the maximum rate at the very beginning of the epidemic (reactive culling) when the culling cost is low, or never to cull, when culling cost is high. On the other hand, in the cases of quadratic control or limited resources, we demonstrated that the optimal strategy is always reactive. Numerical analyses for hosts with logistic growth showed that, in the case of linear control, the optimal strategy is always reactive when culling cost is low. In contrast, if the culling cost is high, the  optimal strategy is to delay control, i.e. not to cull at the onset of the epidemic. Finally, we showed that for diseases with the same basic reproduction number delayed control can be optimal for acute infections, i.e. characterized by high disease-induced mortality and fast dynamics, while reactive control can be optimal for chronic ones.

Diffuse, pleomorphic, round cell infiltrates, mainly  histiocytes, with a tumor-like growth pattern at gross examination, infiltrated the stomach, pancreas, omentum, and mesenteric lymph nodes. The histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells had concentric, target-like inclusions known as Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. Microorganisms were not detected by the periodic acid-Schiff reaction, Ziehl-Neelsen, Gram, and Warthin-Starry staining or by electron microscopic and bacteriologic investigations. Porcine circovirus type 2  and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses were not detected by immunohistochemistry in the sections examined.  © The Author(s) 2013.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy.  Four-hundred and forty-two F4+ pathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated in a period of 10 years (2002-2011), from pigs that were suffering from diarrhoea belonging to Italian swine herds. The strains were analysed for their susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials using the disc diffusion method. During the study period, a statistically significant proportion of isolates resistant to enrofloxacin (14.5-89.3%), marbofloxacin (5.4-60.7%), flumequine (49.1-92.9%), danofloxacin (21.6-80%), florfenicol (9.8-64.3%), thiamphenicol (50-92%) and cefquinome (3.8-44%) was recorded. An increase in resistance (not statistically significant) to gentamicin (63.6-85.7%), apramycin (61.8-82.1%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (75-89.3%), tetracycline (97-100%) and erythromycin (92.4-100%) was also observed. Based on antimicrobial multiresistance, the strains were collected into three groups: I. resistant to 2-5 antimicrobials; II. resistant to 6-8 antimicrobials; III. resistant to 9-12 antimicrobials. The number of isolates belonging to the first group showed a statistically significant decrease (P < 0.05; R(2)  = 0.896; r = -0.9608), while  the isolates belonging to the second and third groups showed a statistically significant increase in resistance (P < 0.05; R(2)  = 0.753; r = 0.8890 and P < 0.05; R(2)  = 0.727; r = 0.8701, respectively) over the period of study.

Author information:  (1)Laboratorio di Entomologia Sanitaria, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia ed Emilia-Romagna, Via Pitagora 2, 42100, Reggio Emilia, Italy.  This study investigates the pupal development times of the blow fly Calliphora vicina, which were studied in the laboratory at six different constant temperatures (15, 20, 23, 25, 28, and 30°C each ± 1°C). Lower thresholds (tL ) for development were estimated from the linear regression of the developmental rates on each temperature. These data have made it possible to calculate the accumulated degree days (ADD) necessary for C. vicina to complete the larval stage and to achieve adult emergence. The minimal duration of development from oviposition to adult emergence was found to be inversely related to temperature.  Additionally, six landmarks in pupal development are showed, and for each of the  landmarks, the ADD value was calculated for every rearing temperature involved. These data assist in calculating the duration of the pupal stage based on morphological characteristics and would be of great value for future forensic entomological casework.  © 2013 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.

Razzuoli E(1), Villa R, Amadori M.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna , Brescia, Italy .  Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) shows potent immunomodulatory properties, which underlies its use for low-dose oral treatments of diverse viral infections and immunopathological conditions. The studies on oral administration have been hampered by the lack of recognized in vitro models, reproducing the in vivo control action of IFN-α over inflammatory cytokine responses. Owing to these reasons, the aim of our study was to validate IPEC-J2 (a continuous cell line of  porcine intestinal epithelial cells) as a reporter system of the properties of IFN-α. Three different experimental conditions (oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and amplification of lymphoid cell signals) were selected to evaluate the effects of porcine recombinant IFN-α1 (rIFN-α) and 2 natural porcine IFN-α preparations (nIFN-α). The IFNs under study showed significantly different control actions in IPEC-J2 cells. In particular, rIFN-α was shown to down-regulate interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and β-defensin 1 genes either directly, or indirectly through second messengers released by IFN-α-treated lymphoid cells. With regard to IL-6, only second messengers from IFN-α-treated lymphoid cells could regulate the expression of this cytokine. Our results suggest that IPEC-J2 cells can be a useful tool for investigating the regulatory actions of type I IFNs and the second messengers thereof. The results provided by this model could be conveniently exploited in studies on enteric diseases sustained by infectious or noninfectious stressors.

Resistance to challenge with the fully virulent strain S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 was assessed in animals vaccinated with S. Typhimurium ΔznuABC (two dosages tested), in controls vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated virulent strain and in unvaccinated controls. Clinical signs of salmonellosis, faecal shedding and bacterial colonization of organs were used  to assess vaccine-induced protection. After the challenge, pigs vaccinated with the attenuated S. Typhimurium ΔznuABC strain did not display clinical signs of salmonellosis (fever or diarrhoea). The vaccine also reduced intestinal tract colonization and faecal shedding of the fully virulent Salmonella strain, as compared to control groups. S. Typhimurium ΔznuABC represents a promising candidate vaccine against salmonellosis in pigs.  Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Antonio Bianchi 9, Brescia, Italy. stefano.giovannini@izsler.it  Mycoplasma bovis is an important cause of bovine respiratory disease, especially  in young calves where it can also cause arthritis, tenosynovitis and otitis. During 2009 and 2010 a survey was carried out on carcasses of calves less than one month old sent to the Diagnostic Laboratory of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna in Brescia, regardless of the  presence of lung lesions, to detect this pathogen. PCR tests for Mycoplasma spp.  and M. bovis were applied. 83 out of 224 (37%) lung tissue samples examined were  positive at PCR test for Mycoplasma spp.; in 64 cases of these we observed typical respiratory lesions (P<0.001). M. bovis was identified in 26 out of 83 (31%) lung tissue samples positive at PCR test for Mycoplasma spp.; in 24 cases of these we observed typical respiratory lesions (P=0.039). Our data demonstrate  that presence of Mycoplasma spp. and M. bovis positively correlates with pneumonic lung lesions in young dairy calves.  Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Considering the wide distribution of wild boars and the feeding behaviour (omnivorous scavengers), wild boars may be a good indicator for environmental presence of Salmonella spp. The aims of this study were to determine the presence of Salmonella spp. in hunted wild boars and to determine the serotype the isolated strains. FINDINGS: Over three hunting seasons, the intestinal contents of 1,313 boars hunted in northern Italy were sampled and cultured. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 326 boars (24.82%). Thirty different serovars belonging to three different S. enterica spp. were found. Twenty-one serovars of S. enterica subsp. Enterica were found including the human pathogens S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. In addition, nine serovars belonging to S.enterica subsp. diarizonae and S. enterica subsp. houtenae were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the widespread occurrence of wild boars in Europe, the epidemiological role of this species in relation to salmonellosis might be relevant and should be further investigated. Wild boars may act as healthy carriers of a wide range of Salmonella serotypes.  DOI: 10.1186/1751-0147-55-42  PMCID: PMC3669099	23692883

Calzolari M(1), Bonilauri P, Bellini R, Albieri A, Defilippo F, Tamba M, Tassinari M, Gelati A, Cordioli P, Angelini P, Dottori M.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna B. Ubertini (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy. mattia.calzolari@izsler.it  BACKGROUND: The circulation of West Nile virus and Usutu virus was detected in the Emilia-Romagna region in 2008 and 2009. To evaluate the extent of circulation of both viruses, environmental surveillance, based on bird and mosquito testing,  was conducted in 2008 and gradually improved over the years. METHODS: In February-March 2009-2011, 5,993 hibernating mosquitoes were manually  sampled, out of which 80.1% were Culex pipiens; none tested positive for the viruses. From 2008 to 2011, 946,213 mosquitoes, sampled between May and October,  were tested; 86.5% were Cx. pipiens. West Nile virus was detected in 32 Cx. pipiens pools, and Usutu virus was detected in 229 mosquito pools (217 Cx. pipiens, 10 Aedes albopictus, one Anopheles maculipennis s.l., and one Aedes caspius). From 2009 to 2011, of 4,546 birds collected, 42 tested positive for West Nile virus and 48 for Usutu virus. West Nile virus and Usutu virus showed different patterns of activity during the 2008-2011 surveillance period. West Nile virus was detected in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but not in 2011. Usutu virus, however, was continuously active throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The data strongly suggest that both viruses overwinter in the surveyed area rather than being continually reintroduced every season. The lack of hibernating mosquitoes testing positive for the viruses and the presence of positive birds sampled early in the season support the hypothesis that the viruses overwinter in birds rather than in mosquitoes. Herd immunity in key bird  species could explain the decline of West Nile virus observed in 2011, while the  persistence of Usutu virus may be explained by not yet identified reservoirs. Reported results are comparable with a peri-Mediterranean circulation of the West Nile virus lineage 1 related strain, which became undetectable in the environment after two to three years of obvious circulation.

Nassuato C(1), Boender GJ, Eblé PL, Alborali L, Bellini S, Hagenaars TJ.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy.  In 2006 and 2007 pig farming in the region of Lombardy, in the north of Italy, was struck by an epidemic of Swine Vesicular Disease virus (SVDV). In fact this epidemic could be viewed as consisting of two sub-epidemics, as the reported outbreaks occurred in two separate time periods. These periods differed in terms  of the provinces or municipalities that were affected and also in terms of the timing of implementation of movement restrictions. Here we use a simple mathematical model to analyse the epidemic data, quantifying between-farm transmission probability as a function of between-farm distance. The results show that the distance dependence of between-farm transmission differs between the two periods. In the first period transmission over relatively long distances occurred with higher probability than in the second period, reflecting the effect of movement restrictions in the second period. In the second period however, more intensive transmission occurred over relatively short distances. Our model analysis explains this in terms of the relatively high density of pig farms in the area most affected in this period, which exceeds a critical farm density for  between-farm transmission. This latter result supports the rationale for the additional control measure taken in 2007 of pre-emptively culling farms in that area.  DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0062878  PMCID: PMC3647039	23667534

Zanardi G(1), Boniotti MB, Gaffuri A, Casto B, Zanoni M, Pacciarini ML.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia ed Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, Brescia, Italy. giorgio.zanardi@izsler.it  A tuberculosis (TB) outbreak caused by Mycobacterium bovis occurred in a mixed herd of three cattle and eighteen goats in Northern Italy in 2005. All the cattle were removed, as opposed to the co-existing goats, who remained in the farm and were not subsequently tested by the official intradermal tuberculin test. At the  beginning of May 2006, a 7-day old calf was introduced into the herd from an officially TB-free (OTF) farm. On October 2006, tuberculous lesions were detected at the slaughterhouse in the same animal. The following epidemiological investigation on the herd highlighted a clinical suspicion of TB in one goat out  of 35, and visible lesions were found at necropsy in the respiratory and intestinal tracts. Bacteriological culture and molecular tests confirmed the presence of M. bovis in both animals. Spoligotyping and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units - Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) showed the same genomic profile of the previous breakdown occurred in 2005. Since this profile has never been described in Italy, these findings suggest the probable transmission of TB within the farm among cattle and goats. The remaining 34 goats were also tested by single intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin (SICCT) test, Interferon (IFN)-γ assay and ELISA for antibody to M. bovis. The SICCT test and the IFN-γ showed a good concordance with 20 and 19 positive reactors, respectively. By ELISA we found 12Ab-positive animals, seven of which had not been detected by the tests for cell-mediated immunity. Finally, 15 goats  were found positive for gross lesions at necropsy. The in vivo tests revealed a total of 27 positive animals out of 35, which highlights the usefulness of the serology in parallel with SICCT and IFN-γ when an advanced stage of infection is  suspected. Moreover, our results confirm the necessity for adopting the official  tuberculin test on goats co-existing with cattle.  Copyright © 2013. Published by Elsevier India Pvt Ltd.

Author information:  (1)Department of Food Microbiology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy. enrico.pavoni@izsler.it  Norovirus (NoV) are increasingly important as etiological agents of gastrointestinal infections. Consumption of bivalve molluscs and ready-to-eat fishery products is one of the most common ways of acquiring NoV foodborne infections, and the rise of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis represents an important health problem that is also responsible for economic losses. The aim of this work was to define the prevalence of NoV contamination in preserved fishery  products and in shellfish commercialized in Italy, taking into account the results obtained during 9 years of survey (2003-2011) and paying special attention to the regions more involved in national production. A total of 4463 samples were examined (2310 mussels, 1517 clams, 510 oysters, 22 other shellfish  species, 104 preserved seafood products) and the average positivity rate for NoV  presence was 4.1% and ranged from 0.6% in 2007 to 9.8% in 2003 and from 1.9% in preserved seafood products to 4.7% in mussels. Genetic characterization of circulating strains showed a prevalence of genogroup II genotypes, including GII.b and GII.e polymerase types and different GII.4 variants. This information could contribute to the optimization of risk-based sampling strategies for NoV contamination in seafood, taking into account variability in different species and from year to year.

Investigation on the origin of prednisolone in urine and adrenal glands of cows.  Bertocchi L(1), Dusi G, Ghidelli V, Hathaway T, Nassuato C, Casati A, Fidani M, Pompa G, Arioli F.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna B. Ubertini, Brescia, Italy.  Prednisolone is a steroid belonging to the corticosteroid group. The results obtained in the application of the 2008 and 2009 Italian Residue Control Plans show the frequent detection of prednisolone traces in cow's urine. Since most of  the positive samples were detected at the slaughterhouse, the researchers hypothesised that, together with an increase of cortisol concentration, traces of prednisolone could be produced endogenously during stressful situations due to transport and handling before slaughter. In the present trial, 52 lactating cows  housed in seven different farms in Lombardy, Italy, were studied. Urine samples were collected at the farm (after urethral catheterisation) and immediately after slaughter (from urinary bladder) together with 40 adrenal gland samples belonging to the same animals. All the samples were analysed for the determination of prednisolone and cortisol by LC/MS(n). The results demonstrated that prednisolone can be endogenously produced in dairy cows and, furthermore, its endogenous presence in bovine urine seems to be strongly related to a state of stress in the animals (at the farm and at the slaughterhouse). The data from adrenal glands do  not, however, clarify if the endogenous production occurs, partially or totally,  in this organ.  DOI: 10.1080/19440049.2013.781273 	23566227

Autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells for regeneration of injured equine ligaments and tendons: a clinical report.  Renzi S(1), Riccò S, Dotti S, Sesso L, Grolli S, Cornali M, Carlin S, Patruno M,  Cinotti S, Ferrari M.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. sabrina.renzi@izsler.it  The use of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) in orthopedic practice has recently and rapidly acquired an important role. Therapies based on the use of MSCs for the treatment of acute injuries as well as chronic inflammatory disorders are gradually becoming clinical routine. These cells have demonstrated intriguing therapeutic potentialities (i.e.: inflammation control, tissue regeneration and pathological scar prevention), that have been taken into consideration for use in both human and veterinary medicine. In particular, horses represent high performance athletes considered models for human pathologies since musculo-skeletal disorders frequently occur in this species. In the past, repair  of tendon injures were performed by different methods. In particular, clinical therapy was based on ice application, bandage, box rest and controlled exercise.  An alternative approach consisted on the use of corticosteroid (inflammation reduction) and other drugs (sodium hyaluronate, polysulphated glycosaminoglycans, beta aminoproprionitrile fumarate). Furthermore, surgical treatments like accessory ligament desmotomy, local irritation by line firing or pin firing were  commonly used. More recently ultrasound, laser therapy, electromagnetic field therapy have been considered. Unfortunately, they did not allow complete tissue healing and quite often animals did not regain competitiveness. In order to minimize this inconvenience, the use of MSCs has been introduced as an alternative to the traditional approach since it represents a potential tool to improve tissue regeneration. Aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of  MSCs to improve the functional outcome of horses affected by tendonitis and desmitis. Thirty-three breed and activity-matched horses affected by tendonitis or desmitis, were included in clinical trial scored for lesions and subdivided into two groups. Group 1 animals were treated with autologous MSCs, associated with platelet rich plasma (group 1). Bone marrow samples were collected from the  sternum of the treated horses and processed in order to isolate MSCs. Following cell therapy, they were subjected to a rehabilitation period and their ability to resume training was evaluated. In this study, implanted MSCs caused no adverse reactions and thirteen out of the eighteen inoculated horses returned to race competitions. On the contrary, no improvement was seen in the twelve animals of group 2 treated with pin firing, that were not able to resume sport activity. In  conclusion the clinical trial proves the safety of equine bone-marrow derived MSCs and a successful outcome of the treated animals that returned to their previous level of sport activity.

A simple and reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for determination of ochratoxin A in hard cheese.  Biancardi A(1), Piro R, Galaverna G, Dall'Asta C.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Via Bianchi, 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy.  This paper reports a simple and reliable mass spectrometry hyphenated chromatographic method for ochratoxin A determination in hard cheese. The method  is based on a simple extraction using an acetonitrile:water (84:16, v/v) solution acidified with 2.5% acetic acid. After a defatting step with n-hexane, the extract was directly analysed by LC-MS/MS without any further clean-up step. The  method showed good linearity and specificity, and it was in-house validated in the range of 1-16 μg/kg, resulting in 93.75% mean overall recovery (confidence interval 1.36%) and 3.42% coefficient of variatioin (CV). The analytical performances were also satisfactory in terms of sensitivity (limit of quantification = 1 μg/kg); although no legal limits have been set up for cheese,  this value is consistent with the tolerances fixed for other regulated foods. Preliminary results on 40 commercial samples of grated hard cheese are presented.  DOI: 10.3109/09637486.2013.763911 	23369011

Sozzi E(1), Moreno A, Lelli D, Cinotti S, Alborali GL, Nigrelli A, Luppi A, Bresaola M, Catella A, Cordioli P.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna "B. Ubertini" (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy.  In this study, we undertook the genomic characterization of 54 pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains isolated in Italy during 1984-2010. The characterization was based  on partial sequencing of the UL44 (gC) and US8 (gE) genes; 44 strains (38 for gene gE and 36 for gC) were isolated on pig farms; 9 originated from dogs and 1 from cattle. These porcine PRV strains, which were closely related to those isolated in Europe and America in the last 20 years, and the bovine strain bovine/It/2441/1992 belong to cluster B in both phylogenetic trees. Six porcine strains that do not belong to cluster B are related in both gE and gC phylogenetic trees to the 'old' porcine PRV strains isolated in the 1970s and 1980s. In the last two decades, the presence of these strains in domestic pig populations has been reduced drastically, whereas they are prevalent in wild boar. The two remaining strains have an interesting genomic profile, characterized by the gC gene being closely related to the old porcine PRV strains, and the gE gene being similar to that of recently isolated strains. Three strains originating from working dogs on pig farms are located in cluster B in both phylogenetic trees. Five strains isolated from hunting dogs have a high degree of correlation with PRV strains circulating in wild boar. The last isolate has a gC gene similar to that in the two porcine strains mentioned previously, and the gE gene is correlated with the strains isolated from hunting dogs. These  results provide interesting insight into the genomic characterization of PRV strains and reveal a clear differentiation between the strains isolated from hunting dogs that are related to the wild boar strains and those originating from domestic pigs.  © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

Time-course of antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus under field conditions.  Dotti S(1), Guadagnini G, Salvini F, Razzuoli E, Ferrari M, Alborali GL, Amadori  M.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Della Lombardia e Dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), via A. Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy.  Major discrepancies are observed between experimental trials of PRRS-virus (PRRSV) infection in isolation facilities and observations made in the field on farm. Owing to the above, a cohort study was carried out in a farrow-to-finish, PRRSV-infected pig farm to characterize the time-course of the virus-specific immune response in two groups of replacement gilts. Despite the occurrence of three and two distinct waves of infection in groups 1 and 2, respectively, the large majority of animals showed little if any PRRSV-specific response in an interferon-gamma release assay on whole blood, whereas non-specific responses were consistently observed. To rule out any possible bias of our test procedure,  this was used along with an ELISPOT assay for interferon-gamma-secreting cells with the same reagents on a group of PRRS-virus infected pigs in isolation facilities. A very good agreement was shown between the two sets of results. Also, as opposed to the PRRS model, plenty of Pseudorabies virus-vaccinated pigs  under field conditions scored positive in another experiment in the interferon-gamma release assay, ad hoc modified for the Pseudorabies virus. Our results indicate that under field conditions poor or no development rather than delayed development of the PRRS virus-specific interferon-gamma response could be the rule for a long time in non-adult pigs after PRRS virus infection. Housing and hygiene conditions, as well as heavy exposure to environmental microbial payloads in intensive pig farms could adversely affect the host's immune response to PRRS virus and partly account for the discrepancies between experimental and field studies.

Although the infection can be caused by both Prototheca zopfii genotype 2 and Prototheca blaschkeae, the bulk of prevalence of bovine protothecal mastitis has been so far attributed to the former, being P. blaschkeae only sporadically isolated. However, we report here the first outbreak of bovine mastitis caused by P. blaschkeae in an Italian dairy herd. One hundred  and four individual milk samples, three bulk tank milk and 16 environmental samples within the herd were screened for the presence of Prototheca: five, one and four positive samples, were respectively observed. Molecular analysis revealed that, with the sole exception of one environmental isolate belonging to  P. zopfii genotype 2, all Prototheca strains were identified as P. blaschkeae. Our results might suggest that even P. blaschkeae can induce mastitis outbreaks,  while it is not clear if the higher incidence of P. zopfii genotype 2 as causative agent of protothecal mastitis could reflect an intrinsic higher pathogenicity or it could be simply the consequence of its, so far observed, higher diffusion in worldwide dairy herd ecosystems.

Mapping of antigenic sites of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype Asia 1 and relationships with sites described in other serotypes.  Grazioli S(1), Fallacara F, Brocchi E.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, Brescia, Italy.  Knowledge of the antigenic structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has relevance in the development of diagnostic assays, in the evaluation of the antigenic variability and in the selection of appropriate vaccine strains. Antigenic sites have been investigated only in FMDVs of serotypes O, A and C, while it would be valuable to extend studies also to other serotypes. This paper  reports the identification of antigenic sites involved in virus neutralization in the FMDV serotype Asia 1 by using a new panel of mAbs and their relation with sites described in other serotypes is discussed. Out of 24 mAbs raised against the FMDV serotype Asia 1, 10 neutralize viral infectivity and were used to select FMDV mutants resistant to neutralization. On the basis of their reactivity profile with virus mutants, the 10 neutralizing mAbs were clustered in four groups corresponding to four independent antigenic sites. By comparing the amino  acid sequence of the parental virus and of virus mutants, the amino acids crucial for the four sites were mapped at the following positions: VP1 140-142, VP2 67-79, VP3 58/59 and VP3 218. Three of the four neutralizing sites identified and mapped on FMDV serotype Asia 1 correspond structurally and functionally to analogous sites described in FMDV serotypes O, A and C, enforcing the evidence that these are dominant antigenic sites in the FMDV structure. The fourth site, located at the C terminus of VP3, is a new independent site, described for the first time in FMDV.  DOI: 10.1099/vir.0.048249-0 	23197575

Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) is performed on the defatted milk plus sodium chloride by using ethyl acetate as an extraction solvent. Accuracy and precision were evaluated at the LOQ (15 ng kg(-1)) spiked sample as well as with  three other different naturally contaminated reference materials. The mean overall recovery (n = 24) was 95% with a confidence interval of 1.9% and a CV% of 4.5%. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of the Official ISO Method based on the use of immunoaffinity chromatography columns (IAC): LLE protocol could be considered a valid alternative to the LC-IAC. In general it showed better accuracy with lower data dispersion. Moreover, the sample preparation is very simple and straightforward, potentially being applicable as a high-throughput method which, on account of its simplicity and low cost, may be applied to the analysis of a large number of samples in the occasion of outbreaks of large-scale contamination.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. anamaria.morenomartin@izsler.it  Diagnostic and containment measures are essential for the management of avian influenza. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based competitive ELISA for detecting antibodies against H5 avian influenza viruses was developed and validated. Twenty-five anti-H5 MAbs were characterised using competitive, indirect and sandwich ELISAs, immunofluorescence, Western blotting and virus neutralisation and haemagglutination inhibition assays. One MAb (5D8) with wide intra-subtype cross-reactivity was selected and characterised using escape mutant selection. Epitope analysis showed that this MAb recognises a conformational epitope comprising amino acid residues in positions 170, 235 and 240 located in the receptor binding domain. The diagnostic performance of the test was evaluated by ROC analysis using a panel of 950 known sera collected from different avian species, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, pheasants, wild Anseriformes and ostriches. The competitive ELISA had excellent diagnostic performance and discriminatory power with high Se and Sp values (Se: 99.6-95% CI 98.0-100; Sp: 99.4-95% CI 98.5-99.8). In addition to its excellent diagnostic performance, properties of the competitive ELISA, such as high feasibility of testing sera without pre-treatment and potential for automation and instrument-mediated detection, make it ideal for screening samples, confirming positive HI assay results or analysing samples that are difficult to test using the HI assay.

Environmental methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus contamination in pig herds in relation to the productive phase and application of cleaning and disinfection.  Merialdi G(1), Galletti E, Guazzetti S, Rosignoli C, Alborali G, Battisti A, Franco A, Bonilauri P, Rugna G, Martelli P.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Italy. giuseppe.merialdi@izsler.it  The aim of the study is to better understand MRSA environmental contamination in  pig holdings in relation to the productive phase and the application of environmental cleaning and disinfection practices (C&D). This study was carried out on six herds. Dust samples from farrowing crates, weaning boxes, growing and  finishing pens were collected from each herd environment prior to and after C&D and cultured for MRSA. Ten samples were collected at the end of each productive phase with the animals present and 10 additional samples were collected after C&D, prior to introduction of a new stock. The proportion of positive samples prior to C&D was lower in fattening than in other phases. The proportion of positive samples prior to and after C&D was 121/240 (50%) and 46/240 (19%) respectively. In the mixed effects logistic regression analysis it was shown not  only that both productive phase and C&D were associated with the probability of having a positive sample but also that the C&D effect was different in the different productive phases. In particular the effect of C&D was stronger in farrowing crates than in the other productive phases. The results of this study show that, although current practices of cleaning and disinfection reduce MRSA environmental contamination, they are likely to be inadequate to the elimination  of the microorganism. However, a strict application of hygienic protocols can lead to a marked reduction of MRSA environmental contamination.  Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dusi G(1), Vago G, Ghidelli V, Pellegrino RM, Galarini R.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, B. Ubertini, Via Bianchi 9, 25124, Brescia, Italy.  Since 2008, the analyses carried out in the Lombardia region as part of National  Residue Control Plans have evidenced unexpected frequent detection of the corticosteroid prednisolone (PRED) in cow urine samples taken to the slaughterhouse. Considering the scarce plausibility of these high frequent findings, analytical investigations were started to ascertain the real presence of this corticosteroid. The applied confirmatory method involved liquid-chromatography low-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (triple quadrupole) as instrumental technique, and it was validated in compliance with the requirements of the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. However, recently some criticism regarding Commission Decision 2002/657/EC identification criteria has been pointed out, experimentally demonstrating false positive results (wrong identification) although these criteria have been strictly observed. Therefore, considering the serious implications (i.e. the possibility that PRED could be considered endogenous in particular animal conditions), studies were carried out  to investigate the reliability of PRED identification through the change of the chromatographic conditions (mobile phases, gradient and analytical column) of the confirmatory procedure routinely applied. Further confirmation came from the application of high-resolution mass spectrometry technique (MS(2) and MS(3) experiments) to analyze incurred cow urines samples. All the obtained results confirmed definitively the real presence of this corticosteroid excluding false-positive findings in routine analysis. In addition, other experiments demonstrated that high-resolution mass spectrometers (Time of Flight and Orbitrap technologies) could be successfully applied to routine determination of steroid residues in biological fluids at very low concentrations (< 1 µg L(-1)).

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, IZSLER, Brescia, Italy. davide.lelli@izsler.it  Summary This study describes the isolation and molecular characterization of Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) in microbats. Faecal samples and dead individuals available from rehabilitation centres or collected from known roost sites were virologically tested. In total, 112 carcasses of bats found dead, and 44 faecal samples were analysed. Nineteen viral strains were isolated by in vitro cell culture from faecal and tissue samples of different bat species (Pipistrellus khulii, Tadarida teniotis, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Vespertilio murinus), and they were morphologically identified as reoviruses by negative staining electron  microscopy observation. The definitive assignment of all isolates to MRV was confirmed by RT-PCR assays targeting the L1 gene. Through a multiplex RT-PCR assay targeting the S1 gene, we typed 15 of 19 isolates as MRV type 3. Partial L1 (416 bp) and complete S1 (1416 bp) sequences of the isolates were analysed and compared with those of reference strains obtained from GenBank, belonging to the  three serotypes. Molecular analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the amino acid residues associated with neurotropism (198-204NLAIRLP, 249I, 350D and 419E) were  highly conserved among the Italian bat strains. These results suggest that potentially neurotropic MRV type 3 strains are widespread among Italian bats. Furthermore, the identification of MRV type 3 in bat species such as Pipistrellus Khulii, which is common in urban areas and known for its close contact with humans, underlines the need for vigilance.  © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

Lombardo T(1), Dotti S, Renzi S, Ferrari M.  Author information:  (1)Cell Culture Centre, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. tina.lombardo@libero.it  Influenza outbreaks are widespread in swine and avian populations. Disease control is jeopardized by the extreme antigenic variability of virus strains. Primary isolation of Influenza virus is performed using embryonated chicken eggs  (ECE), but alternatives to ECE are badly needed. Although various cultured cells  have been used for propagating Influenza A viruses, few types of cells can efficiently support virus replication. One of the most commonly cell lines used in order to isolate Influenza A virus, is represented by the Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line, but cells derived from primary swine organs (kidney, testicle, lung and trachea) can also be employed. The aim of this study was the evaluation of NSK, MDCK, UMNSAH/DF1 cell lines suitability, compared to ECE for isolation and propagation of Avian and Swine virus subtypes. The results indicated both NSK and MDCK could provide an appropriate substrate for cultivating either Avian (AIV) or Swine (SIV) Influenza virus strains, especially for high pathogenicity Avian Influenza ones. Furthermore, NSK appeared more susceptible than MDCK cells for primary isolation of AIV. In contrast, UMNSAH/DF1 cell line seemed to be less permissive to support Avian virus growth. Furthermore, no SIV replication was detected except for one subtype. Additionally, the results of this study indicated that not all virus strains seemed to adapt with the same efficiency to the different cell lines. On the contrary, chicken embryos were shown to be the most suitable biological system for AIV isolation.  Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna B  Ubertini, Brescia, Italy. mattia.calzolari@izsler.it  BACKGROUND: In 2008, after the first West Nile virus (WNV) detection in the Emilia-Romagna region, a surveillance system, including mosquito- and bird-based  surveillance, was established to evaluate the virus presence. Surveillance was improved in following years by extending the monitoring to larger areas and increasing the numbers of mosquitoes and birds tested. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A network of mosquito traps, evenly distributed and regularly activated, was set up within the surveyed area. A total of 438,558  mosquitoes, grouped in 3,111 pools and 1,276 birds (1,130 actively sampled and 146 from passive surveillance), were tested by biomolecular analysis. The survey  detected WNV in 3 Culex pipiens pools while Usutu virus (USUV) was found in 89 Cx. pipiens pools and in 2 Aedes albopictus pools. Two birds were WNV-positive and 12 were USUV-positive. Furthermore, 30 human cases of acute meningoencephalitis, possibly caused by WNV or USUV, were evaluated for both viruses and 1,053 blood bags were tested for WNV, without any positive result. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite not finding symptomatic human WNV infections during 2010, the persistence of the virus, probably due to overwintering, was confirmed through viral circulation in mosquitoes and birds, as well as for USUV. In 2010, circulation of the two viruses was lower and more delayed than in 2009,  but this decrease was not explained by the relative abundance of Cx. pipiens mosquito, which was greater in 2010. The USUV detection in mosquito species confirms the role of Cx. pipiens as the main vector and the possible involvement  of Ae. albopictus in the virus cycle. The effects of meteorological conditions on the presence of USUV-positive mosquito pools were considered finding an association with drought conditions and a wide temperature range. The output produced by the surveillance system demonstrated its usefulness and reliability in terms of planning public health policies.  DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0038058  PMCID: PMC3364206	22666446

Multiplex RT-PCR assay for differentiating European swine influenza virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2.  Chiapponi C(1), Moreno A, Barbieri I, Merenda M, Foni E.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna Bruno Ubertini, Sezione Diagnostica di Parma, via dei Mercati 13/A, 43126 Parma,  Italy. chiara.chiapponi@izsler.it  In Europe, three major swine influenza viral (SIV) subtypes (H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2) have been isolated in pigs. Developing a test that is able to detect and identify the subtype of the circulating strain rapidly during an outbreak of respiratory disease in the pig population is of essential importance. This study describes two multiplex RT-PCRs which distinguish the haemagglutinin (HA) gene and the neuraminidase (NA) gene of the three major subtypes of SIV circulating in Europe. The HA PCR was able to identify the lineage (avian or human) of the HA of H1 subtypes. The analytical sensitivity of the test, considered to be unique, was assessed using three reference viruses. The detection limit corresponded to 1×10(-1) TCID(50)/200μl for avian-like H1N1, 1×10(0) TCID(50)/200μl for human-like H1N2 and 1×10(1) TCID(50)/200μl for H3N2 SIV. The multiplex RT-PCR was first carried out on a collection of 70 isolated viruses showing 100% specificity and then on clinical samples, from which viruses had previously been isolated, resulting in an 89% positive specificity of the viral subtype. Finally, the test  was able to identify the viral subtype correctly in 56% of influenza A positive samples, from which SIV had not been isolated previously. It was also possible to identify mixed viral infections and the circulation of a reassortant strain before performing genomic studies.  Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. davide.lelli@izsler.it  BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of West Nile virus (WNV) infections is often difficult due  to the extensive antigenic cross-reactivity among flaviviruses, especially in geographic regions where two or more of these viruses are present causing sequential infections. The purpose of this study was to characterize a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) produced against WNV to verify their applicability in WNV diagnosis and in mapping epitope targets of neutralizing MAbs. METHODS: Six MAbs were produced and characterized by isotyping, virus-neutralization, western blotting and MAb-epitope competition. The MAb reactivity against various WNVs belonging to lineage 1 and 2 and other related flaviviruses was also evaluated. The molecular basis of epitopes recognized by neutralizing MAbs was defined through the selection and sequencing of MAb escape  mutants. Competitive binding assays between MAbs and experimental equine and chicken sera were designed to identify specific MAb reaction to epitopes with high immunogenicity. RESULTS: All MAbs showed stronger reactivity with all WNVs tested and good competition for antigen binding in ELISA tests with WNV-positive equine and chicken sera. Four MAbs (3B2, 3D6, 4D3, 1C3) resulted specific for WNV, while two MAbs (2A8, 4G9) showed cross-reaction with Usutu virus. Three MAbs (3B2, 3D6, 4D3) showed neutralizing activity. Sequence analysis of 3B2 and 3D6 escape mutants showed an amino acid change at E307 (Lys → Glu) in the E protein gene, whereas 4D3 variants identified mutations encoding amino acid changed at E276 (Ser → Ile) or E278 (Thr → Ile). 3B2 and 3D6 mapped to a region on the lateral surface of domain III of E protein, which is known to be a specific and strong neutralizing epitope for WNV, while MAb 4D3 recognized a novel specific neutralizing epitope on domain II of E protein that has not previously been described with WNV MAbs. CONCLUSIONS: MAbs generated in this study can be applied to various analytical methods for virological and serological WNV diagnosis. A novel WNV-specific and neutralizing MAb (4D3) directed against the unknown epitope on domain II of E protein can be useful to better understand the role of E protein epitopes involved in the mechanism of WNV neutralization.

Patrizia, Mulatto [corrected to Mulatto, Patrizia].  Ticks are the main vectors of rickettsiae of the spotted fever group, as well as  of a variety of other Rickettsiales, including bacteria of the genus Anaplasma, that might cause diseases in humans and animals. Here we present the result of a  survey for ticks and for tick-associated Rickettsiales in the Emilia Romagna region (Northern Italy). The study was focused on ticks collected from wild-hunted animals. Out of 392 ticks collected from these animals, 282 (72%) were identified as Ixodes ricinus, 110 (28%) as Dermacentor marginatus. The former was found on four vertebrate species, whereas the latter appeared more specific for wild boar. The presence of rickettsiae was demonstrated in 22.5% of  I. ricinus (57/253) and in 29% of D. marginatus (32/110). Five ticks of the species I. ricinus were also positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2%). In addition, we collected ticks by dragging in a natural park of the same region. All of the ticks captured by dragging were identified as I. ricinus. Thirty-six out of 200 analyzed ticks proved positive for Rickettsia monacensis and R. helvetica (16.5 and 1.5%, respectively). Our results highlight that that ticks present in wild areas, widely exploited for recreation and hunting in Emilia-Romagna, represent a risk for the transmission of spotted fevers and anaplasmosis to humans.

In addition, the genus includes flaviviruses without a known vertebrate reservoir, which have been detected only in insects, particularly in mosquitoes, such as cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus, Culex flavivirus, Aedes flavivirus, Quang Binh virus,  Nakiwogo virus and Calbertado virus. Reports of the detection of these viruses with no recognized pathogenic role in humans are increasing in mosquitoes collected around the world, particularly in those sampled in entomological surveys targeting pathogenic flaviviruses. The presence of six potential flaviviruses, detected from independent European arbovirus surveys undertaken in  the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK between 2007 and 2010, is reported in this work. Whilst the Aedes flaviviruses, detected in Italy from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, had already been isolated in Japan, the remaining five viruses have not been reported previously: one was detected in Italy, Portugal and Spain from Aedes mosquitoes (particularly from Aedes caspius), one in Portugal and Spain from Culex theileri mosquitoes, one in the Czech Republic and Italy from Aedes vexans, one in the Czech Republic from Aedes vexans and the  last in the UK from Aedes cinereus. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the close relationship of these putative viruses to other insect-only flaviviruses.  DOI: 10.1099/vir.0.040485-0 	22377581

Survey of pleuritis and pulmonary lesions in pigs at abattoir with a focus on the extent of the condition and herd risk factors.  Merialdi G(1), Dottori M, Bonilauri P, Luppi A, Gozio S, Pozzi P, Spaggiari B, Martelli P.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy.  Cranioventral pulmonary consolidation (enzootic pneumonia-like lesions) and chronic pleuritis (CP) are common findings in slaughtered pigs. Pleural lesions involving dorsocaudal lobes are suggestive of pleuropneumonia due to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. In this report the results of an abattoir survey of pleuritis and pulmonary lesions in pigs is presented with a focus on herd risk factors. A total of 4889 animals, ranging in age from 9 to 10 months, from 48 batches of pigs belonging to an equal number of herds, were included in the study. Bronchopneumonic lesions suggestive of enzootic pneumonia (EP-like lesions) were detected in 46.4% of the examined lungs. The EP-like lesion average value for all lungs was 1.03 (95% CI 0.98-1.08), ranging from 0.17 to 2.56 among  the 48 batches; 47.5% of lungs showed chronic pleuritis. Dorsocaudal pleuritis suggestive of recovered pleuropneumonia (SPES score ≥2) was found in 25.1% of the lungs. The mean SPES (slaughterhouse pleuritis evaluation system) value of the overall 4889 lungs was 0.83 (95% CI 0.78-0.86). The mean SPES value of the batches ranged from 0.04 to 1.87. The mean Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae index  of all studied batches was 0.61 (95% CI 0.51-0.71), ranging from 0 to 1.84. Blood samples were collected from each herd to evaluate antibody titres to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, A. pleuropneumoniae, Aujeszky's disease virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and swine influenza virus. Herd characteristics were recorded using a questionnaire given to the farmers. A  multivariable analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for pleuritis and EP-like lesions. High dorsocaudal pleuritis was associated with A. pleuropneumoniae seroprevalence and history of A. pleuropneumoniae isolation from pneumonic lungs of dead animals. Vaccination of weaners at 3-5 weeks of age against PRRS using a modified live vaccine was associated with a reduction in the percentage of cranioventral pulmonary consolidation (EP-like lesions).

The H1N2 subtype was detected for the first time in Italian pigs in 1998. To investigate the genetic characteristics and the molecular evolution of this subtype in Italy, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences  of 26 strains isolated from 1998 to 2010. Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genes showed differences between the older (1998-2003) and the more recent strains (2003-2010). The older isolates were closely related to the established European H1N2 lineage, whereas the more recent isolates possessed a different NA  deriving from recent human H3N2 viruses. Two other reassortant H1N2 strains have  been detected: A/sw/It/22530/02 has the HA gene that is closely related to H1N1 viruses; A/sw/It/58769/10 is an uncommon strain with an HA that is closely related to H1N1 and an NA similar to H3N2 SIVs. Amino acid analysis revealed interesting features: a deletion of two amino acids (146-147) in the HA gene of the recent isolates and two strains isolated in 1998; the presence of the uncommon aa change (N66S), in the PB1-F2 protein in strains isolated from 2009 to 2010, which is said to have contributed to the increased virulence. These results demonstrate the importance of pigs as mixing vessels for animal and human influenza and show the presence and establishment of reassortant strains involving human viruses in pigs in Italy. These findings also highlighted different genomic characteristics of the NA gene the recent Italian strains compared to circulating European viruses.  Published by Elsevier B.V.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, National Reference Centre for Paratuberculosis, Podenzano (PC), Italy. matteo.ricchi@izsler.it  Analysis of micro- and minisatellite loci is widely used in sub-typing of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Microsatellite (short sequence repeat, SSR) loci have shown highest discriminatory power, but direct sequencing  of amplicons is required for correct assignment of the repeat number. We developed an alternative method to sequencing, focusing on the SSR8 locus (constituted by GGT triplets from three to six repeats). The approach is based on asymmetric quantitative PCR, followed by high-resolution melting analysis with unlabelled probes (UP-HRM). Data showed perfect concordance between direct sequencing and UP-HRM, which is faster, simpler and more cost effective.  © 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, National Reference Centre for Paratuberculosis, Strada Faggiola 1, 29027 Gariga di Podenzano, Piacenza, Italy. matteo.ricchi@izsler.it  BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) is the etiological  agent of paratuberculosis. The aim of our study was to combine Mini-and Microsatellite loci analysis in order to explore the effectiveness of this sub-typing method in a group of Map isolates. For this purpose, 84 Italian Type C Map isolates, each from a different cattle herd, were submitted to MIRU-Variable-Number Tandem-Repeats (VNTRs) typing and Short Sequence repeats (SSRs) sequencing. Moreover, the method was used to analyse the variability inside 10 herds (from three to 50 isolates per herd). RESULTS: The molecular sub-typing, carried out using three SSR and 10 MIRU-VNTR loci, differentiated the 84 isolates into 33 clusters, reaching a Simpson's Discriminatory Index (SID) value of 0.952 (0.933 to 0.972, 95% confidence intervals). Among all considered loci, six (SSR2, MIRU2, SSR1, SSR8, VNTR3527 and VNTR1067) showed relevant allelic variability. Thirty-eight% of the isolates were clustered into four genotypes, differing from each other for the SSR2 locus. The  other isolates, characterised by differences in two or more loci, were spread among the rest of the clusters. The intra-herd analysis revealed more than one genotype in most herds with a similar distribution of clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the advantage of using both Mini-and Microsatellite approaches for successfully discriminating among Map Type C isolates from the same geographic area, host species and herd. These data suggest that the combination of loci here proposed could be a useful molecular tool for regional epidemiological studies.  DOI: 10.1186/1746-6148-7-54  PMCID: PMC3182896	21929793

Fiorentini L(1), Taddei R, Moreno A, Gelmetti D, Barbieri I, De Marco MA, Tosi G, Cordioli P, Massi P.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy.    In April 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza A virus (pH1N1) was recognized as the cause of the flu pandemic in humans. Here, we report the isolation of pH1N1 virus from  the lung homogenates of two cats, which died after severe respiratory symptoms. The cats belonged to a cat colony consisting of 90 caged cats and were found dead following a 2-week period of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in the colony. During the outbreak, 25 cats died and 50% of the animal colony showed anorexia, depression, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Histological examination of the lungs of the two tested cats displayed lesions centred on terminal airways with epithelial bronchiolar hyperplasia and alveolar necrosis. Influenza A virus was detected in the lung tissues by immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). Partial sequences of haemagglutinin (HA) genes and complete sequences of neuraminidase (NA) genes of the two isolates displayed high similarity to the pH1N1 viruses circulating in humans (99% for HA gene and 100% for NA gene). To determine whether the pandemic virus had circulated among cats,  serum samples and pharyngeal swabs were collected from 38 cats of the colony. Serum samples were tested by ELISA to detect antibodies against pH1N1 nucleoprotein and by hemagglutination-inhibition test, while pharyngeal swabs were examined by pH1N1 specific rRT-PCR. Twenty-one (55%) of the tested cats carried antibodies against the isolated strain and two swabs were positive for the presence of pH1N1 RNA. Our results confirm that the pH1N1 virus was able to infect cats and raise the hypothesis of the circulation of the virus within the colony being due to cat-to-cat transmission. The case reported here provides, to  the best of the authors' knowledge, the first description of the pH1N1 infection  involving numerous cats that lived in a restricted area with limited contact with humans.  © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

By mouse bioassay, Clostridium botulinum toxin in both the suspected food samples was detected and identified as type B toxin. The detection of C. botulinum toxin  in the artichoke preserve indicates an inadequate food production technology while the presence of C. botulinum toxin in the vegetable soup appeared to be related to wrong behavior on the part of the consumer and to faulty food preservation. The study confirms that an early identification and reporting of suspected botulism cases is vital in the prevention of accidental widespread outbreaks.  	21811749

Ubertini, Brescia, Italy. guglielmo.dusi@izsler.it  A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) confirmatory method for the simultaneous determination of nine corticosteroids in liver, including the four MRL compounds listed in Council Regulation 37/2010, was developed. After an enzymatic deconjugation and a solvent extraction of the liver tissue, the resulting solution was cleaned up through an SPE Oasis HLB cartridge. The analytes were then detected by liquid chromatography-negative-ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, using deuterium-labelled internal standards. The procedure was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria. The results showed that the method was  suitable for statutory residue testing regarding the following performance characteristics: instrumental linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), recovery, decision limit (CCα), detection  capability (CCβ) and ruggedness. All the corticosteroids can be detected at a concentration around 1 μg kg(-1); the recoveries were above 62% for all the analytes. Repeatability and reproducibility (within-laboratory reproducibility) for all the analytes were below 7.65% and 15.5%, respectively.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Razzuoli E(1), Villa R, Sossi E, Amadori M.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Brescia, Italy.  A few studies provided convincing evidence of constitutive expression of type I interferons (IFNs) in humans and mice, and of the steady-state role of these cytokines under health conditions. These results were later confirmed in pigs, too. In line with this tenet, low levels of IFN-α/β can be detected in swine tissues in the absence of any specific inducer. These studies are compounded by the utmost complexity of type I IFNs (including among others 17 IFN-α genes in pigs), which demands proper research tools. This prompted us to analyse the available protocols and to develop a relevant, robust, reverse transcription (RT) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection system for the amplification  of porcine IFN-α/β genes. The adopted test procedure is user-friendly and provides the complete panel of gene expression of one subject in a microtitre plate. Also, a proper use of PCR fluorochromes (SYBR(®) versus EvaGreen(®) supermix) enables users to adopt proper test protocols in case of low-expression  porcine IFN-α genes. This is accounted for by the much higher sensitivity of the  test protocol with EvaGreen(®) supermix. Interestingly, IFN-β showed the highest  frequency of constitutive expression, in agreement with its definition of 'immediate early' gene in both humans and mice. Results indicate that the outlined procedure can detect both constitutively expressed and virus-induced IFN-α/β genes, as well as the impact of environmental, non-infectious stressors on the previous profile of constitutive expression.  © 2011 The Authors.

Affected birds showed watery eyes, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, reduction of feed and water consumption, and gasping with expectoration of blood-stained mucus. The mortality rate was < 10%. Gross lesions consisted of conjunctivitis, excess of mucus, blood, or presence of diphtheritic membranes in  trachea. A real-time PCR assay was performed to confirm the presence of ILT virus (ILTV) DNA in tracheal tissue homogenates. Twenty-three ILTV isolates were propagated on the chorion-allantoic membrane of embryonated chicken eggs showing  typical plaques. PCR combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism and gene sequencing of isolates showed a high genetic correlation between field strains and chicken embryo origin vaccines.

This method was based on the amplification of a 122bp fragment of the highly conserved kDNA minicircles of L. infantum. The reaction was performed using the StepOnePlus™ system with StepOne software™. This assay was able to detect the presence of protozoan parasite DNA in amounts as low as 0.03 parasites per reaction. The standard curve designed for the quantification of parasites showed linearity over seven log DNA concentration range with a correlation coefficient >0.999 and both  intra- and inter-assay variability demonstrated the high efficiency and reproducibility of the assay. The qPCR also proved to be successfully applicable  to different clinical samples including blood, bone marrow, lymph node aspirates  and conjunctival swabs.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Lombardy, a densely populated pig area, was most affected and the presence of the disease caused heavy economic losses to the entire pig industry. Although SVD is considered only moderately contagious, the epidemic in the north was characterised by a rapid spread of the condition. Numerous difficulties were encountered in eradicating it. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the population of pigs in Lombardy, concentrated mainly in a few areas which were the most severely affected during the 2006 to 2007 SVD epidemic. Increases in both the pig population and animal movements, combined with weak biosecurity measures, increased the spread rate of the disease and hampered eradication activities.  	21309461

In Italy, this parasite was reported only in two night-birds of prey of Central Italy. In January 2010, Trichinella larvae were detected in three wild boars (Sus scrofa) of two regions of Northern Italy by enzymatic digestion. The parasites were identified as T. pseudospiralis by multiplex-PCR. The first infected wild boar was hunted in the Emilia Romagna region and the other two infected wild boars were bred outdoors in a small family farm of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. These new epidemiological data reinforce the role of the wild boar as the main reservoir of T. pseudospiralis in Europe.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multilocus variable-number of tandem-repeats analysis of Salmonella enterica serotype Gallinarum and comparison with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotyping.  Bergamini F(1), Iori A, Massi P, Pongolini S.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna -  Sezione di Modena, Via E. Diena 16, 41100 Modena, Italy.  Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum is the causative agent of fowl typhoid, a  severe disease of poultry, responsible for heavy economic losses. Epidemiologic investigation of fowl typhoid significantly benefits from molecular typing tools, RAPD and PFGE have been proposed for this purpose. PFGE, a well established technique, is still the gold standard among typing methods for most bacteria, including salmonella. Nevertheless, it has some limitations regarding execution and reproducibility, in particular it is labour intensive and requires good technical expertise. Furthermore, it needs accurate standardization and results can be ambiguous to interpret. Such limitations can hamper reproducibility and transfer of results. As a possible alternative to PFGE, multilocus variable-number of tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) has recently emerged as an effective genotyping method for many bacterial pathogens showing high discriminatory power associated to robustness. We developed a six-loci MLVA protocol for Salmonella Gallinarum and compared it to PFGE performed with SpeI, XbaI and NotI on fifty isolates. The proposed MLVA has a high discriminatory power, equivalent to that of the three-enzyme PFGE (Simpson's index 0.94 for MLVA, 0.93 for three-enzyme PFGE) but it is simpler to perform and straightforward in genotype identification, allowing unambiguous exchange of results. Stability of selected VNTR loci, assessed in vitro and in vivo, is good  but not absolute, reflecting the sensitivity of MLVA to detect evolutionary changes of bacteria. Clustering of the isolates as determined by MLVA typing is substantially confirmed by PFGE.  Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.  DOI: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.12.002 	21208755

This paper reports the isolation and genomic characterization of a novel H1N2 swine influenza reassortant strain from pigs in Italy that was derived from the H1N1pdm virus. In May 2010, mild respiratory symptoms were observed in around 10% of the  pigs raised on a fattening farm in Italy. Lung homogenate taken from one pig showing respiratory distress was tested for influenza type A and H1N1pdm by two real time RT-PCR assays. Virus isolation was achieved by inoculation of lung homogenate into specific pathogen free chicken embryonated eggs (SPF CEE) and applied onto Caco-2 cells and then the complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed from the CEE isolate. The lung homogenate proved to be positive for both influenza type A (gene M) and H1N1pdm real time RT-PCRs. Virus isolation (A/Sw/It/116114/2010) was obtained from both SPF CEE and Caco-2 cells. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the genes of A/Sw/It/116114/2010, with the exception of neuraminidase (NA), belonged to the H1N1pdm cluster. The NA was closely related to two H1N2 double reassortant swine  influenza viruses (SIVs), previously isolated in Sweden and Italy. NA sequences for these three strains were clustering with H3N2 SIVs. The emergence of a novel  reassortant H1N2 strain derived from H1N1pdm in swine in Italy raises further concerns about whether these viruses will become established in pigs. The new reassortant not only represents a pandemic (zoonotic) threat but also has unknown livestock implications for the European swine industry.  Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This method originally developed for testing human sera was adapted for the analysis of pig sera. All farms except one (97.43%) and 714 sera samples (50.21%) resulted positive for anti-HEV IgG antibodies. This study confirms that HEV is widespread  in pigs in Italy and might be endemic on most farms.  DOI: 10.3402/iee.v1i0.7331  PMCID: PMC3426339	22957120

Ubertini (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy. mattia.calzolari@izsler.it  BACKGROUND: In recent years human diseases due to mosquito-borne viruses were increasingly reported in Emilia-Romagna region (Italy), from the chikungunya virus in 2007 to the West Nile virus (WNV) in 2008. An extensive entomological survey was performed in 2009 to establish the presence and distribution of mosquito arboviruses in this region, with particular reference to flaviviruses. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From May 6 to October 31, a total of 190,516 mosquitoes were sampled in georeferenced stations, grouped in 1,789 pools according date of collection, location, and species, and analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of RNA belong to Flavivirus genus. WNV was detected in 27 mosquito pools, producing sequences similar to those of birds and human strains obtained in 2008 outbreak,  pointed out the probable virus overwintering. Isolation of WNV was achieved from  one of these pools. Moreover 56 pools of mosquitoes tested positive for Usutu virus (USUV). Most PCR positive pools consisted of Culex pipiens, which also was  the most analyzed mosquito species (81.4% of specimens); interestingly, USUV RNA  was also found in two Aedes albopictus mosquito pools. Simultaneous circulation of WNV and USUV in the survey area was highlighted by occurrence of 8 mosquito WNV- and USUV-positive pools and by the overlaying of the viruses "hot spots", obtained by kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis. Land use of sampled stations pointed out a higher proportion of WNV-positive Cx. pipiens pool in rural environments respect the provenience of total sampled pool, while the USUV-positive pools were uniformly captured in the different environments. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Obtained data highlighting the possible role of Cx. pipiens mosquito as the main vector for WNV and USUV in Northern Italy, and the possible involvement of Ae. albopictus mosquito in USUV cycle. The described mosquito-based surveillance could constitute the foundation for a public health alert system targeting mosquito borne arboviruses.

Razzuoli E(1), Villa R, Sossi E, Amadori M.  Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Brescia, Italy.  The interferon (IFN)-α response of pigs to the stressing event of early weaning was investigated in a field trial. All the animals under study remained healthy and tested negative for common viral infections. However, a low-titered IFN-α response was detected in many sera by a bioassay on Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells on day +6 after weaning. Porcine IFN-α was unambiguously identified  by a neutralization assay on a pool of IFN-α-positive sera. By gel filtration chromatography, the antiviral activity of sera on MDBK cells could be traced back to 3 components of apparent molecular mass 27/18/<14 kDa. Additional components of apparent molecular mass 58 and 41 kDa were revealed by ELISA in Nonidet P-40 lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Also, many pigs tested positive in flow cytometry assays on PBMC for intracellular IFN-α. The expression of porcine IFN-α genes was investigated by reverse transcriptase (RT) real-time polymerase chain reaction at days -1, +6, and +12 with regard to weaning in PBMC  of 9 piglets. On days -1 and +12, IFN A5, A6, A12, as well as (in fewer pigs) A1, A7, A11, and A2 genes were shown to be expressed. On the contrary, none of the above genes was expressed on day +6, when plenty of pig sera were IFN-α-positive. Our results indicate that weaning causes the release of IFN-α and the transient shut-off of the corresponding gene transcriptions in PBMC. Interestingly, only IFN A9 gene transcription was shown in vitro to be virus induction-dependent.  DOI: 10.1089/jir.2010.0041 	20950132

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e Emilia Romagna, Piacenza, Italy. matteo.ricchi@izsler.it  AIM: The study describes the development of a simple and rapid tool to identify yeast-like microalgae belonging to the genus Prototheca. METHODS AND RESULTS: The method, based on two-step Real Time PCR reaction followed by DNA Resolution Melting Analysis (qPCR/RMA), has been developed using  reference strains belonging to both pathogenic (P. zopfii genotype 2, P. wickerhamii and P. blaschkeae) and non-pathogenic species (P. zopfii genotype 1,  P. stagnora and P. ulmea). In order to validate the method, seventy recently isolated Prototheca strains were thus tested in parallel with both the first qPCR/RMA and the conventional genotype-specific PCR assay: they were classified as P. zopfii genotype 1, P. zopfii genotype 2 and P. blaschkeae, with a perfect accordance between the two above methodologies. Furthermore, we used the second qPCR/RMA to identify the other species (P. stagnora, P. ulmea and P. wickerhamii), which cannot be discriminated by conventional PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS: The assay two-step Real Time PCR is accurate, robust, cost-effective and faster than auxonographical, biochemical or conventional molecular biology methods. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: the rapid and high throughout two-step qPCR/RMA tool can be usefully used for the identification of clinical and environmental Prototheca species into the framework of the diagnosis of animal (e.g. bovine mastitis) or human protothecosis.  © 2010 The Authors.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Brescia, Italy. marco.tamba@izsler.it  Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex, recently related to neurological disease in immunosuppressed patients. In the same area of Northern Italy where USUV human cases occurred in 2009, a regional West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance program based on mosquito monitoring and wild birds screening has been implemented since  2008. Mosquito pools and wild birds were tested using three different polymerase  chain reactions (Flavivirus, WNV, and USUV). During summer 2009, 56 pools (54 consisting of Culex pipiens and 2 of Aedes albopictus) and 27 pools (Cx. pipiens) out of 1789 mosquito pools were, respectively, USUV and WNV positive. Moreover, out of 1218 wild birds tested, 44 were WNV positive, whereas only 11 birds were USUV positive by polymerase chain reaction. Data collected during 2009 prove a cocirculation of USUV and WNV in Northern Italy, but these two viruses show different incidence values in both mosquitoes and birds, suggesting involvement of different animals (other bird species or mammals) in their natural cycles. The cocirculation of WNV and USUV poses a new potential threat to human health in this area. The extent of WNV surveillance to other Flaviviruses will require new  diagnostic procedures able to process a large number of samples in a limited period of time and highlights the importance of developing more specific serological tests that could be used in field.

Moreno A(1), Di Trani L, Alborali L, Vaccari G, Barbieri I, Falcone E, Sozzi E, Puzelli S, Ferri G, Cordioli P.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy.  The first outbreak of the pandemic H1N1 virus in a swine breeder farm in Italy in November 2009 was reported. Clinical signs observed in sows included fever, depression, anorexia and agalactia, while in piglets diarrhoea and weight loss. The morbidity in sows was approximately 30% and the accumulated mortality rate was similar with those usually reported in piggeries (<10%). Virus was isolated from piglets (A/Sw/It/290271/09) and the sequencing of the whole genome was then  performed. Comparison with all (H1N1)v sequences available in GenBank shows A/Sw/It/290271/09 three unique amino-acid (aa) changes in PB2 (S405T), PB1 (K386R) and PA (K256Q), not yet associated to any well characterized phenotype markers of Influenza viruses. All eight aa at positions representing the so-called species specific swine-human signatures, found in both swine and in the pandemic H1N1v, are also present. The M2 protein displays the C55F and the PA protein the S409N substitutions, both corresponding to enhanced transmission phenotype markers. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus was genetically related to the pandemic H1N1 virus. In addition, serological samples were collected from 40 sows, of which 20 resulted positive to the pandemic H1N1 virus  by HI test proving a virus circulation in the farm.

Author information:  (1)Reparto di Genomica, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Brescia 25124, Italy. patrizia.cavadini@izsler.it  Myxoma virus is a poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in European Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The entire genome of the myxoma virus has been sequenced, allowing a systemic survey of the functions of a large number of putative pathogenic factors that this virus expresses to subvert the immune and inflammatory pathways of infected rabbit hosts. In Italy, industrial rabbits are  mostly vaccinated against myxomatosis using the attenuated myxoma virus strains Borghi or SG33. We have identified genetic markers specific for Borghi or SG33 vaccine strains and established a PCR-based assay that could be used to: (a) rapidly diagnose the presence of myxoma virus in infected organs; (b) discriminate between field strain-infected and vaccinated rabbits and (c) differentiate between Borghi or SG33 vaccine strain.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, via A. Bianchi 9, Brescia, Italy.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the time-course of the immune response  to a field Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain in  PRRS-naïve, untreated pigs, as well as in four groups of age and breed-matched pigs injected with a live attenuated PRRS vaccine, its adjuvant, an inactivated PRRS vaccine and an irrelevant, inactivated Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccine, respectively. PRRSV infection was confirmed in all groups by PCR and antibody assays. The antibody response measured by ELISA took place earlier in pigs injected with the live attenuated vaccine, which also developed a much stronger serum-neutralizing antibody response to the vaccine strain. Yet, no clear protection was evidenced in terms of viremia against the field virus strain, which showed 11.1% nucleotide divergence in ORF7 from the vaccine strain. In vitro, the interferon (IFN)-γ response to PRRSV was almost absent on PVD 60 in all groups under study, whereas the prevalence of interleukin (IL)-10 responses to PRRSV was fairly high in PCV2-vaccinated animals, only. Results indicate that  distinct patterns of immune response to a field PRRSV strain can be recognized in PRRS-vaccinated and naïve pigs, which probably underlies fundamental differences  in the development and differentiation of PRRSV-specific immune effector cells.

Razzuoli E(1), Dotti S, Archetti IL, Amadori M.  Author information:  (1)Laboratorio di Immunologia Cellulare, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Brescia, Italy.  Clinical chemistry parameters were investigated in piglets weaned at 22 and 28 days. The effects of an oral, low-dose interferon (IFN)-alpha treatment at weaning were evaluated as well. The trial was carried out on 59 piglets from the  same farm, allocated to three groups: the first and the second groups were weaned at 28 and 22 days of age, respectively; the third group was weaned at 22 days and orally treated at weaning with IFN-alpha at a low dose (1 IU human lymphoblastoid IFN-alpha /kg body weight in drinking water) for 10 consecutive days. The results of the field trial confirmed that weaning is one of the main stressing events for pigs at intensive farms. In particular, these findings are based on a dramatic increase in serum haptoglobin levels after weaning in the three groups under study. Results also indicated that early weaning at 22 days implies higher environmental adaptation. In such animals, an oral, low-dose IFN-alpha treatment  gave rise to a peculiar, negative, acute-phase response (reduced levels of serum  albumin) and to significantly lower alpha-globulin concentrations in sera. Taken  together, IFN-alpha was shown to modulate inflammatory responses to early weaning stress.  DOI: 10.1007/s11259-010-9402-5 	20454853

Ubertini, Brescia, Italy. mattia.calzolari@izsler.it  Recently, Italy-particularly the Emilia-Romagna region-was the location of consecutive outbreaks of human diseases caused by the arboviruses chikungunya virus and West Nile virus. The two outbreaks, spread by different species of mosquitoes, were not related, but pointed out the lack of an arboviral surveillance program in this region. Beginning in 2007 entomological surveillance was initiated in the Emilia-Romagna region, and in 2008 the program was improved  and extended at Lombardia region. Using CO(2)-baited traps, 65,292 mosquitoes were collected; pooled by date of collection, location, and species; macerated manually; and tested by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction for  the presence of alphaviruses, orthobunyaviruses, and flaviviruses. Amplicons were sequenced and employed for identification of viral RNA by basic local alignment search tool search in GenBank. Results of these assays showed (1) the presence of West Nile virus in two pools of Culex pipiens mosquitoes, (2) the presence of RNA of two orthobunyaviruses, Tahyna virus in a pool of Ochlerotatus caspius mosquitoes and Batai virus in a pool of Anopheles maculipennis mosquitoes, and (3) the presence of flavivirus RNAs in pools of Oc. caspius, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes vexans mosquitoes; the sequences of these amplicons were most closely related to flaviviruses that have been detected only in mosquitoes and had no recognized vertebrate host (Aedes flavivirus, Culex flavivirus, and Kamiti River  virus).

This large open-field zoo park located near Lake Garda in Northern Italy hosts one thousand animals belonging to one hundred and fifty different species, including various lemur species. This lemur collection is the most relevant and rich in Italy. A second outbreak between September and November 2008 involved three lemurs. In all cases, the clinical signs were sudden deaths generally without any evident symptoms or only with mild unspecific clinical signs. Gross pathologic changes were characterized by myocarditis (diffuse or focal pallor of  the myocardium), pulmonary congestion, emphysema, oedema and thoracic fluid. The  EMCV was isolated and recognized as the causative agent of both outbreaks. The first outbreak in particular was associated with a rodent plague, confirming that rats are an important risk factor for the occurrence of the EMCV infection.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna-Sezione Diagnostica di Modena, Modena, Italy. elena.carra@izsler.it  In 2001, a compulsory active surveillance system was started in the European Union to assess the prevalence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the cattle population. The aim of the current study was to report on the field performances of 3 rapid tests: a Western blot (WB), a chemiluminescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and an immunochromatographic assay, routinely used at 3 laboratories of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of  Lombardia and Emilia Romagna, over 8 years of BSE monitoring activity. A total of 2,802,866 samples from slaughtered animals and 202,453 samples from fallen stock  were tested by 1 of 3 tests. Positive results of the rapid tests were confirmed by histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, and confirmatory WB. The  field performances (i.e., initial reactive and false-positive rates) and practical aspects regarding resources and applicability of the tests to high-throughput routine testing laboratories were evaluated. The 3 tests proved to be reliable tools when applied to slaughtered samples, showing no or very low  false-positive rates (<1 per 100,000 negative samples tested) and low retesting frequencies (0.02-0.26%). When samples from fallen stock were analyzed, performances of the immunochromatographic assay, and especially the chemiluminescence ELISA, were negatively affected, resulting in higher false-positive and retesting rates. On the other hand, both tests are less expensive, much easier to use, provide more rapid results, and adapt well to application in routine laboratories as compared with WB. In the authors' experience, the immunochromatographic assay was a good compromise between performance and convenience.  DOI: 10.1177/104063870902100610 	19901284

The CACO-2 cell line was compared to the MDCK cell line and embryonated chicken eggs for the isolation of H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 swine influenza A virus subtypes from clinical specimens. From 2006 to 2008, 104 influenza A samples found positive by PCR from  42 respiratory outbreaks in Italian swine farms were examined by virus isolation. Sixty swine influenza A viruses were isolated (16 H1N1, 28 H1N2 and 16 H3N2) and  their growth behaviour on the different substrates was examined. 16/16 H1N1, 28/28 H1N2 and 8/16 of H3N2 viruses were isolated from the CACO-2 cell line, while 7/16 H1N1, 3/28 H1N2 and 16/16 H3N2 viruses were isolated using embryonated chicken eggs. Only 9/16 H1N1, 1/28 H1N2 and 6/16 H3N2 viruses replicated in MDCK  cells. A link was found between viral hemagglutinin and the isolation rate on the various substrates. The CACO-2 line was statistically more sensitive (Fisher's exact test, p<0.01) compared to the MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs for the isolation of H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes. In contrast influenza A H3N2 virus was isolated more readily in embryonated chicken eggs than in cultured cells (Fisher's exact test, p<0.01).  DOI: 10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.09.017 	19781571

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna Bruno Ubertini, Sezione Diagnostica di Pavia, Strada Campeggi 61, Pavia 27100, Italy. simone.magnino@izsler.it  The consumption of a wide variety of species of reptiles caught from the wild has been an important source of protein for humans world-wide for millennia. Terrapins, snakes, lizards, crocodiles and iguanas are now farmed and the consumption and trade of their meat and other edible products have recently increased in some areas of the world. Biological risks associated with the consumption of products from both farmed and wild reptile meat and eggs include infections caused by bacteria (Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp.), parasites (Spirometra, Trichinella, Gnathostoma, pentastomids), as well as intoxications by biotoxins. For crocodiles, Salmonella spp. constitute a significant public health risk due to the high intestinal carrier rate which is reflected in an equally high contamination rate in their fresh and frozen meat. There is a lack of information about the presence of Salmonella spp. in meat from other edible reptilians, though captive reptiles used as pets (lizards or turtles) are frequently carriers of these bacteria in Europe. Parasitic protozoa in reptiles represent a negligible risk for public health compared to parasitic metazoans, of which trichinellosis, pentastomiasis, gnathostomiasis and sparganosis can be acquired through consumption of contaminated crocodile, monitor lizard, turtle and snake meat, respectively. Other reptiles, although found to harbour the above parasites, have not been implicated with their transmission to humans. Freezing treatment inactivates Spirometra and Trichinella in crocodile meat, while the effectiveness of freezing of other reptilian meat is unknown. Biotoxins that accumulate in the flesh of sea turtles may cause chelonitoxism, a type of food poisoning with a high mortality rate in humans. Infections by fungi, including yeasts, and viruses widely occur in reptiles but have not been linked to a human  health risk through the contamination of their meat. Currently there are no indications that natural transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) occur in reptilians. The feeding of farmed reptiles with non-processed and recycled animal products is likely to increase the occurrence of biological hazards in reptile meat. Application of GHP, GMP and HACCP procedures, respectively at farm  and slaughterhouse level, is crucial for controlling the hazards.  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.07.001 	19679367

A total  of 1450 sera from different avian species (854 negative, 185 positive to N1, 136  positive to N2, 219 positive to N3 and 56 positive to other N subtypes sera) were analysed in parallel by the three ELISAs. ROC analyses were performed to enable the selection of best cut-off values and estimation of diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. In addition, the correlation between the new developed ELISAs and the neuraminidase inhibition test was evaluated on a limited number of sera. The  validation process of the three ELISAs proved excellent diagnostic performances,  with very high specificity and sensitivity, ranging from 99.4 to 99.8% and from 97.6 to 100%, respectively in the three assays. The discriminating potential between antibodies elicited against homologous and heterologous N validates the test for use in "DIVA" assays, to distinguish between vaccinated and infected birds.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZSLER), Brescia, Italy. maura.ferrari@bs.izs.it  The H1N1, H3N2 and, more recently, H1N2 subtypes of influenza A virus are presently co-circulating in swine herds in several countries. The objectives of this study were to investigate the pathogenesis of Sw/Italy/1521/98 (H1N2) influenza virus, isolated from respiratory tissues of pigs from herds in Northern Italy, and to evaluate its potential cross-protection against the Sw/Fin/2899/82  (H1N1) strain. In the pathogenesis test, eight pigs were intranasally infected with H1N2 virus; at pre-determined intervals, these animals were killed and necropsied, along with eight uninfected animals. In the cross-protection test, sixteen pigs were infected by intranasal (i.n.) and intratracheal (i.t.) routes with either H1N2 or H1N1 virus. Twenty days later, all pigs were challenged (by the same route), with either the homologous H1N2 or heterologous H1N1 virus strains. Control group was inoculated with culture medium alone. On post-challenge days (PCD) 1 and 3, two pigs from each infected group, along with  one control pig, were killed. Clinical, virological, serological and histopathological investigations were performed in both the pathogenicity and cross-protection tests. In the pathogenicity test, mild clinical signs were observed in two pigs during 3 and 4 days, respectively. Virus was isolated from two pigs over 6 days and from lung samples of pigs killed on post-infection days  2 and 4. Seroconversion was detected in the two infected animals killed 15 days after infection. In the cross-protection study, mild clinical respiratory signs were detected in all pigs infected with either the H1N2 or H1N1 virus. The virus  was isolated from nasal swabs of almost all pigs till 6 days. After the challenge infection, the pigs remained clinically healthy and virus isolation from the nasal secretions or lung samples was sporadic. Antibody titres in H1N1 or H1N2 infected groups were similar, whereas the H1N2 sub-type induced less protection against re-infection by homologous and heterologous virus than H1N1 sub-type. The controls had no signs of the disease. In the H1N2 infected pigs, a reduced number of goblet cells in nasal and tracheal mucosa and small foci of lymphomononuclear  cell infiltrates in the submucosa were detected. Furthermore, the goblet cell reduction was related to the time of infection. Diffuse mild interstitial pneumonia was also recorded in pigs infected with the H1N2 virus and challenged with either H1N1or H1N2 pigs. These studies showed the moderate virulence of the  H1N2 virus and a partial cross-protection against heterologous infection.  DOI: 10.1111/j.1863-2378.2009.01239.x 	19538454

A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) based on the use of monoclonal antibodies was developed for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). The DAS-ELISA was compared  with RT-PCR in the examination of 506 specimens collected during 2006-2007 from pigs originating from different farms located in the Po valley. Both faecal samples obtained directly from the rectum of live animals showing clinical signs  and intestinal samples collected from the caecum of deceased pigs were included in the study. The correlation between the two methods was higher when testing faecal samples (K=0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-1.00) than testing intestinal samples (K=0.62, 95% CI: 0.35-0.89).

Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. massimo.amadori@izsler.it  Interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-gamma positive cells were revealed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Specific Pathogen Free  (SPF) pigs. A low prevalence of IFN-gamma positive cells was also detected in PBMC of some Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus-infected pigs and uninfected, control pigs. IFN-alpha positive cells showed phenotypes of both  monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The presence of IFN-alpha in PBMC was also confirmed by Western blotting. By immunoprecipitation, IFN-alpha was detected as 32 and 55-57 kDa bands in PBMC of healthy SPF piglets. These samples  were also IFN-gamma positive; the cytokine was revealed as 24, 37 and 54 kDa bands. The unusual molecular mass values of intracellular interferons were probably due to oligomerization, as previously described for human IFN-alpha. Swine intracellular IFN-alpha displayed the expected antiviral activity on bovine MDBK cells. The results indicate that interferons are constitutively expressed in swine leukocytes with peculiar molecular features.  Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

After an enzymatic deconjugation, the urine was subjected to a one-step cleanup on a commercially available immunoaffinity chromatography cartridge. The analytes were detected by  liquid chromatography-positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using deuterium labelled internal standards. The analytical procedure was applicable to bovine and swine urine samples. The procedure was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria. The results obtained showed that the method was suitable for statutory residues testing regarding the following performance characteristics: instrumental linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), recovery, decision limit (CCalpha), detection capability (CCbeta) and ruggedness. The decision limits (CCalpha) obtained, were between 0.54 and 0.60 microg L(-1); the recovery was above 64% for all the analytes.

Author information:  (1)Department of Animal Health, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy. anamaria.morenomartin@bs.izs.it  To date, three subtypes of swine influenza viruses, H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 have been isolated in Italy. In 2006, a novel swine influenza virus subtype (H3N1) was isolated from coughing pigs. RT-PCR performed on lung tissues, experimental infection in pigs with the novel isolate, and cloning the virus by plaque assay confirmed this unique H and N combination. The novel isolate was also antigenically and genetically characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis showed that the complete HA gene of the H3N1 strain has the highest nucleotide identity to three Italian H3N2 strains, one isolated in 2001 and two in 2004, whereas the full length NA sequence is closely related to three H1N1 subtype viruses isolated in Italy in 2004. The remaining genes are also closely related to respective genes found in H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs currently circulating in Italy. This suggests that the novel SIV could be a reassortant between the H3N2 and H1N1 SIVs circulating in Italy.  DOI: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.04.007 	19398171

The presence of zeranol (alpha-zearalanol) in urine samples due to natural contamination or illegal treatment is under debate within the European Union. The simultaneous determination of zeranol, its epimer taleranol (beta-zearalanol), zearalanone and the structurally related mycotoxin zearalenone with the corresponding alpha- and beta-zearalenol metabolites appears to be critical in deciding whether an illegal use has occurred. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a simple analytical procedure applicable to bovine and swine urine samples for the determination of all six resorcylic acid lactones. After an enzymatic deconjugation, the urine was subjected to a one-step cleanup on a commercially available immunoaffinity chromatography cartridge. The analytes were detected by liquid chromatography-negative-ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using deuterium-labelled internal standards. The method was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to European Commission  Decision 2002/657/EC. The evaluated parameters were: linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), recovery, decision limit, detection capability and ruggedness. The decision limits (CCalpha) obtained, were between 0.56 and 0.68 microgL(-1); recovery above 66% for all the analytes.

Ubertini", Via Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy.  A simple and rapid multiresidue method for the determination of seven sulphonamides residues (sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline) in milk samples was developed and validated. The drugs were extracted with a mixture chloroform/acetone and simply cleaned up on a cation exchange solid phase extraction column. The analytes determination was carried out using liquid chromatography with diode array detection (DAD). The procedure has validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the European Union (EU) Decision 2002/657/EC. The developed method shows good linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), ruggedness and is able to confirm each sulphonamide residue above 30mugkg(-1). Decision limits (CCalpha) around 110mugkg(-1) and recovery above 56% were obtained for all the analytes. The results of the validation process demonstrate that the method is suitable for application, as confirmatory method, in European Union statutory veterinary drug  residue surveillance programmes. In addition, a hypothetical situation of sample  judgement (compliance or not) in the case in which, at the same time, two different sulphonamides are found, is discussed.

A new genotyping strategy for efficient scoring of closely positioned SNPs in the ovine prion protein gene.  Pongolini S(1), Bergamini F, Bassi S.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Via E. Diena, 16 - 41100 Modena, Italy. stefano.pongolini@bs.izs.it  Amino-acid polymorphisms of the ovine prion protein have been known to influence  susceptibility to scrapie for many years. Recently, a role in both classical and  atypical scrapie was assigned to new mutations, increasing the overall number of  polymorphisms of interest for breeding plans. Besides, the high number and density of polymorphisms in the prion protein gene (PrP) and the presence of unusual mutations in some breeds hampers genotyping methods, making multiplexing  difficult and sometimes compromising analytical results. We developed a multiplex genotyping method for the ovine PrP that overcomes the limitations posed by the high number and density of the polymorphisms to interrogate. Nine primers were designed to be compatible in a single primer-extension reaction developed for routine genotyping, with the capacity to identify the following polymorphisms: A136V, M137T, L141F, I142K, R154H, Q171R, Q171H, Q171K and N176K. Site-specific mutations were inserted in primer sequences in order to prevent extension of reciprocally complementary primers. Complete accuracy and repeatability of the assay was assessed with reference to 97 sequenced samples. The presented method constitutes an improved tool for ovine PrP genotyping and a general strategy for  the use of primer extension in a genetic context of high density of polymorphisms.

Author information:  (1)Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Brescia, Italy. massimo.amadori@bs.izs.it  Interferon-α (IFN-α) at low concentrations had been previously shown to control the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in swine pulmonary alveolar macrophages. In the first part of this study, cultured swine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were supplemented with IFN-α at low/moderate concentrations, and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The expression of IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 genes was determined by real-time PCR. IFN-α at low/moderate concentrations did not significantly reduce the expression  of any cytokine gene under study, with clear trends though to a concentration-dependent reduction of IL-1β gene expression and to a concentration-dependent increase of IFN-γ gene expression. In vivo, orally administered IFN-α was shown instead to modulate the inflammatory response to early weaning in uncultured PBMCs of specific pathogen-free piglets. As opposed to the in vitro model, the oral IFN-α treatment reduced after weaning the expression of the IFN-γ gene (P < 0.08) and increased that of the IL-1β gene (P < 0.05). There was also a trend to a reduced expression of both IL-6 and TNF-α. The above modulation of cytokine genes expression and the greater daily mean weight gain of treated piglets highlight important regulatory properties of oral IFN-α in the response to the weaning stress.

Pongolini S(1), Bergamini F, Iori A, Migliore S, Corradi A, Bassi S.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Via E. Diena 16, 41100 Modena, Italy. stefano.pongolini@bs.izs.it  Amino acid polymorphisms of the prion protein gene influence sheep susceptibility to classical and atypical scrapie. Substitutions at codons 136, 154 and 171 play  an important role in classical scrapie. Codon 141 leucine to phenylalanine mutation (AFRQ) has been recognized as an increased risk factor for atypical scrapie. In addition a rare allele with lysine at codon 171 (ARK) has been detected in Mediterranean sheep breeds. The presence of ARK poses two problems: the determination of its frequency and its possible interference with genotyping  output of routine methods lacking specific detection capacity for ARK. The aim of our work was the development of a routine genotyping method with the capacity to  identify ARK and AFRQ in addition to the normally detected alleles and to determine the frequencies of all these alleles in 5 main Italian breeds: Sarda (n=2494), Bergamasca (n=2686), Appenninica (n=297), Comisana (n=361) and Massese  (n=402). A multiplex primer extension assay targeting the six single nucleotide polymorphisms of interest was developed. Allele frequencies revealed a very low level of ARR in Bergamasca (6.91%) as opposed to the other breeds, very diverse levels of AFRQ ranging from absence in Comisana to 10.70% in Massese and a restricted presence of ARK. This allele has only been detected in Bargamasca with a significant 3.67% and marginally in Appenninica (0.34%). These results underline the need for adequate routine methods for genotyping of breeds with alleles that can interfere with typing of important codons such as the case of ARK for codon 171.

A number of surveys carried out over the last thirty years across Europe have detected high seropositivity values and high percentages of infection in feral pigeon populations. Overall, when considering data from 11 European countries, seropositivity values to C. psittaci in the sampled populations ranged from 19.4% to 95.6%. In most surveys, the complement fixation test was used, and antibodies  were detected in 19.4-66.3% of the samples, with a median of 46.1%. Indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA tests were employed less frequently, but led to the  detection of higher percentages of seropositivity (23.7-67.7% and 35.9-95.6%, respectively). Attempts to grow C. psittaci in cell culture or embryonated chicken eggs were successful in 2-42.3% and 0-57.1% of samples, respectively, antigen detection methods were positive in 2.3-40% of samples, while conventional PCR and real-time PCR using different genomic targets detected the organism in 3.4-50% of samples. Twenty-five C. psittaci isolates from pigeons were typed as ompA genotype B (n=14), E (n=10) and E/B (n=1). The huge increase of feral pigeon populations in Europe is a major cause of concern for the detrimental effect of pigeon droppings on environmental hygiene, in addition to the extensive damage due to the fouling of buildings and monuments. The most important pathogenic organism transmissible from feral pigeons to humans is C. psittaci, with 101 cases of disease reported in the literature. Exposure to C. psittaci-contaminated dust, direct contact with pigeons through handling and, to a lesser extent, through pigeon feeding have been identified as hazardous exposures in more than half of the human cases, while loose or transient contacts with feral pigeons have been mentioned in about 40% of the cases. Education initiatives as to the communication of a health risk resulting from contact with pigeons and pigeon excreta should primarily be targeted at individuals who may be exposed to C. psittaci-contaminated dust, such as demolition/construction workers. Recommendations to this category of workers include wearing protective clothes with hoods, boots, gloves and air filter face masks when removing pigeon faeces from roofs, garrets and buildings, especially if working indoors. Monitoring for  C. psittaci infections in these workers over time should also be considered. Children should be warned not to handle sick or dead pigeons, and immunocompromised individuals should be advised to carefully limit their contact  to feral pigeons. Culling of pigeons by shooting or poisoning is both unethical and ineffective as the place of the killed birds in the population is quickly filled by new juveniles or immigrating birds from neighbouring areas. Pigeon-deterring systems, such as nets and plastic or metal spikes applied to buildings and monuments will prevent their fouling, and the administration of contraceptive drugs may allow size regulation of the pigeon populations. Nevertheless, the measure that will ultimately lead to permanent reduction and will establish healthy sustainable populations is the restriction of indiscriminate feeding by pigeon lovers. The erection of dovecotes and artificial breeding facilities should be considered for providing shelter and a balanced diet to the birds, as well as a chance of interaction for pigeon lovers in a hygienically controlled environment.

An alternative method to isoenzyme profile for cell line identification and interspecies cross-contaminations: cytochrome b PCR-RLFP analysis.  Losi CG(1), Ferrari S, Sossi E, Villa R, Ferrari M.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy. gioia_losi@yahoo.it  One of the major risks in cell culture laboratories is the misidentification and  cross-contamination of cell lines. Several methods have been used to authenticate cell lines, including isoenzyme profiling, the test suggested by European Farmacopeia, which is performed at the Tissue Culture Centre in Brescia. However, this method displays several disadvantages, such as high variability and low reproducibility, and it is time consuming and requires high cell concentrations to be performed. Therefore, an alternative method has been developed to confirm the specie of origin of 27 different animal cell cultures. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was optimized, based on the use of a pair of primers that anneal to a portion of the  cytochrome b gene in all the species. The amplification product was digested with a panel of six restriction enzymes, and the pattern derived was resolved on 3% high-resolution agarose gel. For 23 species, this protocol produced a unique restriction pattern, and the origin of these animal cells resulted to be confirmed by this analysis. Furthermore, results indicate that cytochrome b PCR-RFLP was able to amplify target sequences using very low amounts of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Its sensitivity in detecting interspecies, cross-contamination was comparable to that of isoenzyme analysis (contaminating DNA should represent at least 10% of the total DNA). For 4 of the 27 species (sheep, dog, Guinea pig, and Rhesus monkey) the observed pattern, even if highly  reproducible, showed additional bands; for these species, specific PCR was also performed.

Five litters were randomly selected from each herd and in each litter six piglets were randomly selected and individually identified. Thus, the study included 30 pigs from each farm. At weaning, individual blood samples were collected for serological examination from all selected piglets and on the same day from all sows in the farrowing unit. Piglets were bled again at approximately 60, 90, 150, 210 and 270 days of life whereas the last blood sample was collected at slaughtering. In one of the herds, in which the duration of productive cycle was about 12 months, the last blood samples were collected at 350 days of life. With the same time scheduling, five pen pooled faecal samples were collected from each herd for bacteriological examination. At slaughtering, mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from each ear-tagged pig. Sero-prevalence (cut off S/P ratio 0.25) in sows varied from 93.8% to 100%. In four herds, sero-prevalence in piglets showed a similar profile with complete decline of maternal antibodies at  day 60 and clear sero-conversion between day 90 and day 150. In one herd, sero-conversion was observed earlier and 56% of piglets were positive at day 90.  The peak of sero-prevalence was observed between day 210 and day 270. Sero-prevalence at slaughtering varied from 66% to 100%. Salmonella was isolated  from faecal samples in four of five herds. No Salmonella was isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes at slaughter in two of the herds. Culture prevalence from  mesenteric lymph nodes in the other three herds ranged from 3.3% to 30%. This longitudinal study provides original information about epidemiological dynamics of Salmonella enterica infection in Italian swine herds in consideration of the unique extended fattening period typical of the Italian production.

These strains, isolated during a bulk milk survey for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), strongly affected Map detection both by PCR and by culture, as they gave a positive IS900 PCR signal and resulted to totally inhibit the growth of Map when spotted on HEYM slants already inoculated with 200 microl  of 10-fold dilutions containing from 5 x 10 to 5 x 10(3)Map cells/ml. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, using the MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA Bacterial Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), was performed on a subset of six strains, identifying Mycobacterium porcinum with 100% homology in all six cases. The 52 strains were characterized by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of  the hsp65 gene, which confirmed the identification of M. porcinum for all the isolates. Using specific primers designed on the Map-IS900 sequence and on the M. porcinum sequence determined in this study, a 1385bp sequence from the M. porcinum genome was characterized. This IS900-like sequence showed 82% homology with Map IS900. From our findings the following results emerged: (a) any culture  showing one or more M. porcinum colonies represents a potential "false negative"  result and should therefore be considered as contaminated; (b) IS900-like elements could be more widespread than was previously thought; (c) IS900 PCR positive results should be interpreted cautiously, as confirmed by the evidence that the primer pair used in this study resulted not to be specific.

The causative agent of SVD was classified as an Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. It was included in the list of diseases notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal  Health (OIE) because of the similarity of its lesions to those produced by FMD; however SVD is often mild in nature and may infect pigs subclinically. During the last decade SVD has been persistently reported in Italy, and surveillance and eradication activities are in place. The central and northern parts of Italy have been designated SVD free since 1997, while the southern regions have not achieved disease-free status. However, occasional outbreaks of SVD have occurred in central and northern Italy and have been eradicated using rigorous control measures. Most recent SVD outbreaks in Italy have been subclinical; SVD can rarely be diagnosed now on the basis of clinical signs and it is necessary to use laboratory diagnosis. This paper examines the epidemiology of SVD in Italy, and considers the measures adopted in Europe for SVD control on the basis of current  knowledge of the disease.  	18293607

The viruses were compared with reference IBDV strains, F52/70 (classical, 1970), 89163 (typical very virulent [vv]IBDV, 1989), 91168 (antigenically modified vvIBDV, 1991) and 94432 (antigenically modified vvIBDV, 1994) among others. All 42 strains were genetically characterized, and the comparison of their nucleotide sequences revealed the presence of six clusters having 100% identity, named group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Twelve strains, representative of each molecular group and/or with interesting amino acid sequence, were also antigenically characterized. The antigenic characterization showed six strains--151573, 157185 (group 1), 192294 (group 2), 77882 (group 3),  217 (group 4), and 192304--with the profile typical of vvIBDV (lack of binding of MAbs 3 and 4). Two strains, 77165 and 204875 (group 6), were also related to vvIBDV but did not react with MAb 5. Three isolates exhibited a profile of cell culture-adapted viruses and classical strains but with some differences: strain 157776 reacted with all MAbs; strain 168026 with all MAbs except MAb 4, which weakly neutralized it; and strain 72293 with all MAbs except MAb 9, which is rather unusual. The last strain, 213622, showed a very uncommon antigenic profile with missing or reduced binding of MAbs 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Genetic characterization revealed 37 strains identified as vvIBDV viruses divided in 26 isolates (including groups 1, 2, 3, and 4) with the four amino acids residues typical of vvIBDV (222A, 256I, 294I, 299S) and 11 isolates (including groups 5, 6, and 213622) with some other amino acid exchanges. Four isolates (72293, 168026, 196783, and 222220) presented an amino acid sequence closely related to attenuated classical viruses whereas the last isolate (157776) exhibited a rather different sequence with some mutations typical of vvIBDV and others for cell culture-adapted viruses. Results of the antigenic and genetic characterization revealed that the majority of viruses (n = 37) were related to vvIBDV strains but, among these, 11 strains presented antigenically and genetically modified characteristics and originated, in major part, from the area where viruses have been circulating for a long time. The remaining viruses (n = 5) were related but  not identical to attenuated classical viruses and came from areas where vaccination with intermediate strains is applied.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via A. Bianchi, 7, 25124, Brescia, Italy. mferrari@bs.izs.it  The use of adult stem cells in tissue regeneration appears to be a powerful research tool, due to the intrinsic characteristics of these cells, i.e., self-renewal and unlimited capacity for proliferation. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from bone marrow or peripheral blood can be easily isolated, cultivated, propagated and can be differentiated into several specialized cell types thanks to their plasticity. Among these cells, MSCs can evolve into cardiac cell lineages. Since heart damage leads to the irreversible loss of cardiac function, cell transplantation could be a potential therapy for heart injury. Our laboratory has focused on the purification and expansion of rat and sheep MSCs, their differentiation into cardiomyocytes and their characterisation. Numerous results indicate that MSCs could be promising for therapy, however we need to better understand the biology of stem cells to improve methods for delivery and/or pharmacological activation. These techniques  can indeed track engrafted cells and systems to guarantee their safe use.  DOI: 10.1007/s11259-007-0003-x 	17682840

Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy. sbellini@bs.izs.it  In Europe in the last decade, swine vesicular disease (SVD) outbreaks have been steadily reported in Italy where surveillance and eradication activities are in place. To collect and analyse data gathered during SVD surveillance activities, the Italian reference centre for vesicular diseases (CERVES) has implemented an integrated information system for the management of the national surveillance plan. The system was developed using Web-based technology and open source software. It was designed to gather, integrate and manage data generated by the activities of the Veterinary Services, the laboratory information system, herd and animal registers and the relevant technical and scientific information. A geographic information system provides an interface for the system, which facilitates the planning, implementation and evaluation of disease control actions. Access to the system is feasible through a second level domain.  	20422532

Development and validation of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the separation of conjugated and unconjugated 17alpha- and 17beta-boldenone in urine sample.  Gasparini M(1), Assini W, Bozzoni E, Tognoli N, Dusi G.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, B. Ubertini, Via Bianchi 7, 25124 Brescia, Italy.  Natural occurrence or illegal treatment of boldenone (BOLD) presence in cattle urine is under debate within the European Union. Separation of conjugated and unconjugated forms of 17alpha-boldenone (alpha-BOLD) and 17beta-boldenone (beta-BOLD) and presence of related molecules as androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD) appear critical points for the decision of an illegal use. The aim of this  study is a new analytical approach of BOLD and ADD confirmation in cattle urine.  The separation between conjugated and unconjugated forms of BOLD was obtained by  a preliminary urine liquid-liquid extraction step with ethyl acetate. In this step the organic phase extracts only unconjugated BOLD and ADD, while BOLD in conjugated form remain in urine phase. Afterwards the urine phase, contains conjugated BOLD, was subjected to an enzymatic deconjugation. Solid-phase extraction (OASIS-HLB Waters) was used for the purification and concentration of  analytes in organic and urine phases and liquid chromatography ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was applied for the confirmation of BOLD and  ADD, using deuterium-labelled 17beta-boldenone (BOLD-d3) as internal standard. The method was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/CE. The results obtained demonstrate that the developed method show very high specificity, precision, trueness and ruggedness.  Decision limits (CCalpha) smaller than 0.5 ng mL(-1) were obtained for each analyte.  DOI: 10.1016/j.aca.2006.08.059 	17386707

The sera came from naïve, vaccinated, infected and vaccinated-and-infected animals; two-thirds from cattle, the remainder from sheep and pigs. The assays were covariant for sensitivity, but not necessarily for specificity. A commercial kit from Cedi-diagnostics and an in-house assay from IZS-Brescia were comparable to the NCPanaftosa-screening index method described in the Diagnostic Manual of the World Animal Health Organisation. Using these three tests the specificity and sensitivity for the detection of carriers in vaccinated cattle approaches or exceeds 99% and 90%, respectively.

A new, rapid and sensitive method is reported for the multiresidual determination of type A (diacetoxyscirpenol, HT-2 toxin, T-2 toxin) and type B (nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, fusarenon X, 15-O-acetyl-4-deoxynivalenol) trichothecenes in wheat flour samples. Sample extraction was performed with acetonitrile/water mixtures. Mycosep columns were used for a fast and effective clean-up procedure.  The analytes were separated by HPLC with a RP C18 column by means of a gradient elution and detected in an ESI-interfaced single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Type B and type A trichothecenes were monitored in the negative and in the positive ion mode, respectively. The method performance is reported in terms of linearity (r2 = 0.999), specificity, accuracy (recoveries from 70-120%) and precision (CV% = 5), the LOQs are in the range 10-20 microg/Kg.

The ground feed samples were extracted using dimethylformamide. The extracts were directly analyzed, without any purification, on a reversed-phase ODS column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) with acetonitrile-phosphate buffer (pH 3; 0.017 M) as mobile phase. Ultraviolet detection of FLUB and FEBA was carried out at 300 nm. The method was validated for specificity, linearity, accuracy, repeatability, limit of detection and limit of quantification. The limits of detection (LOD) of FLUB and FEBA in feeds, based on a detector signal-to-noise ratio of 3, were 3 mg kg(-1) and the lowest levels  tested in feeds by this procedure (limit of quantification, LOQ) were 10 mg kg(-1).

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Sezione Diagnostica di Pavia, Italy.  A 9-year-old female, domestic short hair cat was presented with sudden onset of polyuria/polydipsia, and hundreds of cutaneous nodules. Prior to referral, the cat had had four skin nodules that were treated with steroids. The four skin nodules then multiplied to form more than 100 ulcerated and nonulcerated nodules  located all over the trunk. Clinical evaluation revealed hypothermia and respiratory distress. Cytology from both skin nodules and bronchoalveolar lavage  showed macrophages and small organisms whose shape and size were indicative of Toxoplasma spp., or similar organisms. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) serology results were negative. The cat was seropositive for Toxoplasma (IgG 1 : 640) and Neospora (1 : 80) infections. The cat died soon after referral. Necropsy revealed pyothorax, necrotic/purulent pneumonia, haemorrhagic spots on kidneys and mesentery. Histopathology from skin  nodules showed diffuse, deep necrotic dermatitis/panniculitis, vasculitis and disseminated free and grouped protozoa. The parasites were found in lungs, spleen, kidneys and liver. Immunohistochemistry on skin tissue with anti-Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum antibodies gave positive results with both. Electron microscopy showed single and grouped tachyzoites with morphological features of T. gondii, often within macrophages. Samples of cutaneous nodules and bronchoalveolar fluid were examined by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detecting apicomplexa coccidia. PCR results were consistent only with T. gondii infection. Therefore, immunohistochemistry positivity for N. caninum was considered a cross-reaction and a diagnosis of cutaneous and visceral toxoplasmosis was made.

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy.  Immunosuppression, myeloablation, and the use of immunologically immature tissue  can overcome major histocompatibility complex barriers by inducing tolerance. With the goal of inducing tolerance to BALB/c-derived murine hybridoma cells producing the 4C6 monoclonal antibody (mAb), we transplanted BALB/c fetal tissue  into neonatal pigs during a regimen of low-dose conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. After the tolerance induction phase, animals received intraperitoneal injections of 4C6 mAb hybridoma cells. Evidence of persistence of injected cells over time was sought by molecular analysis of peripheral blood for the presence of mouse genomic sequences and circulating 4C6 mAb. Persistence of donor polymerase chain reaction signal during the entire duration of the study, detectable mAb titer for 6 weeks, and a twofold increase of mAb concentration after a boost hybridoma infusion was observed in one animal receiving six consecutive administrations of the conditioning regimen. Our model has the distinctive advantage of allowing functional monitoring of engrafted cells for studying tolerance induction strategies. In addition, this model could be the basis for approaches aimed at producing mAbs in tolerized large animals.  	15699767

In order to investigate the likelihood of Listeria monocytogenes (serotype 4b, ATCC 19115) growth on vacuum-packaged horsemeat at refrigeration temperature, fourteen horsemeat surface/volume homogeneous 150 g weight pieces were superficially inoculated with serotype 4b L. monocytogenes and vacuum packaged. The samples were stored at 4±1 °C. Two pieces (one for pH determination and one for L. monocytogenes counts) were examined at days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. Surface pH did not show significant variations during the experiment. The average L. monocytogenes initial contamination level was 1.77log(10) CFU/g. A lag phase of 7 days was recorded. The exponential growth rate between day 7 to day 35 was 0.125log(10) CFU/day, corresponding to 3.51log(10) CFU/g in 28 days. At the end of the experiment the mean L. monocytogenes log(10) CFU/g was 5.78.  DOI: 10.1016/j.meatsci.2004.05.014 	22062545

Cats act as the natural reservoir of B. henselae and can transmit the infection to humans by bite or scratch. The diffusion of B. henselae was evaluated by seroprevalence and bacteremic status in different stray cat populations located in nine areas of Northern Italy. A total of 1585 cats were tested by blood culture and 361 (23%) resulted bacteremic; 1416 out off 1585 cats were also tested for Bartonella henselae antibodies and 553 (39%) resulted seropositive. The molecular typing of the isolates showed that 26% of bacteremic  cats were infected with B. henselae type I, 52% with B. henselae type II, 16% were co-infected with both and 5% infected with B. Clarridgeiae. Moreover 165 domestic cats were tested by blood culture and serological test (IFA test cut-off: 1:64). 35 cats (21%) resulted bacteremic and 49 (43.5%) were seropositive. The molecular typing of the Bartonella isolates of the domestic cats showed that 45% of bacteremic cats were infected with B. henselae type I, 36.5% with B. henselae type II, 12% were coinfected with both and 6% infected with B. Clarridgeiae. For a completely evaluation of health status of the cat for B. henselae infection, the authors suggest both blood culture and serological tests. Nevertheless a nonbacteremic cat with positive serology result should be reevaluated for possible recurrent bacteremia.  	15305701

Author information:  (1)Sezione Diagnostica di Pavia, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna "Bruno Ubertini," 27100 Pavia, Italy. mfabbi@bs.izs.it  Bartonella henselae is the major etiological agent of cat scratch disease in humans. Cats act as the natural reservoir of B. henselae and can transmit the infection to humans by a bite or scratch. The prevalence of B. henselae in cat populations was evaluated by serological and bacteriological tests. A total of 769 stray cats from three urban and three rural areas in northern Italy were sampled between January 1999 and December 2000. The positive and the negative predictive values of serological tests with respect to bacteremic status were evaluated. Tests of a total of 140 cats (18%) resulted in detection of bacteremia. A total of 540 cats were tested by serology; 207 (38%) were seropositive. Of the 531 cats tested by both methods, the results for 65 (12.2%)  showed both bacteremia detection and seropositivity. The molecular typing of the  isolates showed that 20.6% of bacteremic cats were infected with B. henselae type I strain, 61.1% were infected with B. henselae type II, and 18.3% were coinfected with both. A statistically significant difference in antibody and bacteremia prevalences among geographical areas was detected. Statistical analysis showed no association between characteristics such as seroprevalence-bacteremic status, sex, general health status, and the presence of ectoparasites. The negative predictive value of serological test was 84.7%, and the positive predictive value was 31.8%. Receiving operator characteristic analysis of the data showed that serological tests had a low predictive value in relation to the bacteremic status of a cat; in surveys aimed at assessing the real risk of B. henselae infection in a human population, therefore, we suggest the use of blood culture as the reference test. Nevertheless, both blood culture assays and serological tests for Bartonella infection should be performed for a complete evaluation of the health  status of cats.   PMCID: PMC321649	14715763

Bianchi 7/9, 25124 Brescia. substr@bs.izs.it  The "Istituti Zooprofilattici" are an important network whose main function is the monitoring of animal health as well as food. As a result of the recent improvements in aquaculture technology interest in the safety of seafood is increasing. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to set up diagnostic methods for the detection of virus contamination, as well as the use of in vitro techniques able to identify the different toxins. The results have allowed the development of molecular biology assays which, together with the isolation in cell cultures, can detect contaminations/infections by the hepatitis A virus and  the most common enteroviruses. Moreover, specific selected cell lines have led to the detection of different toxins. These laboratory methods will be used in order to control seafood safety.  	12820575

Author information:  (1)Department of Immunoprophylaxis and Animal Welfare, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, via A. Bianchi 9, 25124, Brescia, Italy.  Mycobacterium bovis isolation on bacteriological media from suspected cases of bovine tuberculosis (TB) demands laborious and time-consuming procedures. Even polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and radiometric analyses are secondary procedures and not alternatives to bacteriological procedures. Therefore, there is a need to develop new techniques aimed at rapid M. bovis detection in diagnostic samples. The human macrophage cell line THP-1 was thus investigated in experiments of M. bovis propagation and isolation from reference lymph node suspensions. THP-1 cells were shown to support a high-titered propagation within 48h of minute amounts of both M. bovis BCG and fully pathogenic M. bovis strain 503. A semi-nested PCR for TB-complex-specific insertion sequence IS6110 revealed M. bovis infection in THP-1 cells. The same was true of a flow cytometry (FC) assay  for expression of M. bovis chaperonin 10 in infected cells. The reduced time for  isolation and identification of M. bovis (48-72h) and the consistency of the test results make the use of macrophage cell cultures attractive and cost-effective for veterinary laboratories involved in TB surveillance.  	12781479

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Via Bianchi 9, 25124, Brescia, Italy. izsle@iperbole.bologna.it  Vaccination programs to control Aujeszky's-disease virus (ADV) using gE-deleted vaccines are being considered in several European countries. Knowledge of factors influencing ADV-seropositivity for vaccinated herds might contribute to the success of these programs. A multivariable analysis of ADV-seropositivity in 1248 swine herds (332 farrow-to-finish, 260 farrow-to-feeder and 656 finishing herds)  in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy revealed that (1) high pig density (number  of pigs in a 6-km radius), (2) gilt purchasing, and (3) increased number of fattening pigs were risk factors for farrow-to-finish herds. In farrow-to-feeder  herds, ADV-seropositivity was related to (1) increased number of breeders, (2) heavy-gilt purchasing, and (3) increased pig density. In finishing herds, (1) increased herd size was related to ADV-seropositivity, whereas (2) periodic rearing suspension was protective.  	12114009

Borrego B(1), García-Ranea JA, Douglas A, Brocchi E.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, Via Bianchi 7, 25125 Brescia, Italy.  The antigenic linear map of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) has been studied using a repertoire of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against a recombinant SVDV polyprotein, P1. Peptide-scanning analyses, cross-reactivity studies with homologous and heterologous viruses and predicted location on a computer-generated three-dimensional model of the capsid proteins have allowed the identification of five main linear sites. Two sites, the N terminus of VP3 and amino acids 51-60 on VP1, correspond to internal areas, conserved not only between SVDV isolates but also in the related enterovirus coxsackievirus B5. In contrast, three other regions, amino acids 142-161 of VP2, 61-70 of VP3 and the C terminus of VP1, are exposed on the external face of the capsid and subjected to  antigenic variation, even among different SVDV isolates. Further minor sites that were antigenically conserved were identified on VP4. In contrast with conformational sites described previously, none of the linear epitopes identified in this work is involved in neutralization of virus infectivity and post-infection swine sera did not inhibit the binding of mAbs with the relevant epitopes. Both of these observations suggest that linear epitopes are poorly immunogenic in pigs. The characterization of linear sites has contributed to a better understanding of the antigenic structure of SVDV and mAbs used to this purpose may provide a useful tool for the improvement of diagnostic methods, such as antigen detection systems, and analyses of the antigenic profile of SVDV isolates.

Amadori M(1), Tagliabue S, Lauzi S, Finazzi G, Lombardi G, Teló P, Pacciarini L,  Bonizzi L.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna, Brescia, Italy. mamadori@bs.izs.it  Because of the frequent exposure of cattle to mycobacteria of the avium/intracellulare group, an investigation was carried out into the possible repercussions thereof on the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. Three calves from  a bovine tuberculosis-free herd, scored avian reactors in the gamma-interferon assay for bovine tuberculosis, were sedated and inoculated endotracheally with a  virulent Mycobacterium bovis strain. Then, three other avian reactors were housed with the above donor calves. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the nasal swabs of the three endotracheally infected, donor calves. On these samples, TB complex-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for IS6110 were also positive, albeit with a different time kinetics. The three contact-infected calves showed clear immunological signs of infection; however, their nasal swabs  were always PCR-negative and only Mycobacterium avium was isolated. In the endotracheally infected donor calves there was a rise of the gamma-interferon responses to avian and bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculins, which reached the same stable plateau levels over the whole experiment. The above effect was also observed in the contact-infected calves, even though the response to avian PPD tuberculin always remained at a higher level. By using conventional  bovine and avian PPD tuberculins, the comparative intradermal test was generally  positive in endotracheally infected, as opposed to contact-infected calves; a positive intradermal test for M. bovis was obtained in two contact-infected calves by different bovine PPD tuberculins based on M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) secreted or somatic antigens. It was concluded that M. bovis infection may be concealed for some time in cattle sensitized by mycobacteria of the avium/intracellulare group and that different diagnostic procedures should be adopted for such animals.  	12002425
397. J Gen Virol. 2002 Jan;83(Pt 1):35-44.	 Characterization of neutralization sites on the circulating variant of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV): a new site is shared by SVDV and the related coxsackie B5 virus.  Borrego B(1), Carra E, García-Ranea JA, Brocchi E.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna Bruno Ubertini, Via A. Bianchi 9, 25124 Brescia, Italy.  Using a panel of new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), five neutralizing, conformation-dependent sites have been identified on the antigenic variant of swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) circulating currently. In studies on the antigenic conservation of these sites, the four antigenic/genetic groups of SVDV  described showed distinguishable patterns, confirming this classification. By sequencing mAb-resistant mutants, the five sites have been mapped precisely and localized on a three-dimensional model of the SVDV capsid. All were found to be orientated, to a different extent, towards the external surface of the capsid. Three of the five sites, located in VP1, VP2 and VP3, correspond to epitopes identified previously in historic isolates as sites 1, 2a and 3b, respectively. Another site, site IV, which maps to position 258 of VP1, corresponds to an epitope reported recently and is described in this study to be specific for isolates of the most recent antigenic group of SVDV. A fifth site is described for the first time and corresponds to the unique neutralizing site that is common to both SVDV and coxsackie B5 virus; it maps to positions 95 and 98 of VP1, but may also include positions nearby that belong to site 1 on the BC-loop of VP1, suggesting the classification of site Ia. These results may have useful diagnostic and epidemiological applications, since mAbs to the new conserved site Ia provide universal reagents for SVDV detection systems, while the specificity of mAbs to site IV make them unique markers for the most recent strains of SVDV.

A study of the ability of a TK-negative and gI/gE-negative pseudorabies virus (PRV) mutant inoculated by different routes to protect pigs against PRV infection.  Ferrari M(1), Brack A, Romanelli MG, Mettenleiter TC, Corradi A, Dal Mas N, Losio MN, Silini R, Pinoni C, Pratelli A.  Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Via A. Bianchi, 9, 25100 Brescia, Italy.  The capacity of a TK-negative (TK-) and gI/gE-negative (gI/gE-) pseudorabies virus (PRV) mutant to protect pigs against Aujeszky's disease carried out by experimental infection with a virulent PRV strain, was tested. There were three groups, each of four susceptible pigs which were inoculated twice by two different schedules. Group 1 received the modified virus by the intradermal (first inoculation)-intramuscular (second inoculation) routes; group 2 was treated by the intranasal (first inoculation)-intramuscular (second inoculation)  routes. The third group was left untreated as the control. All of the pigs were challenged intranasally with a virulent PRV strain and they were subsequently injected with dexamethasone. Two pigs in each group were necropsied on days 5 and 15 after dexamethasone inoculation. The challenge exposure resulted in mild clinical signs, increase in growth and a shorter period of virus shedding in vaccinated pigs, whereas the control group showed severe signs of Aujeszky's disease. No difference in the titre of the virulent virus which was excreted by pigs of all three groups, was observed and all animals seroconverted. Both the mutant strain and the wild-type virus established a latent infection although only the latter was reactivated and shed. Slight lesions were observed in target  tissues of the vaccinated animals and no significant differences were detected between the two inoculation schedules.  	11204130

Author information:  (1)Department of Chemistry, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia-Romagna B. Ubertini, Brescia, Italy. gdusi@bs.izs.it  A rapid and very effective analytical procedure for the simultaneous liquid chromatographic determination of two coccidiostats, clopidol (CLOP) and nicarbazin (NICA), in poultry feeds was developed and tested. The ground feed samples were extracted using aqueous dimethylformamide after moistening with water. Co-extracted feed constituents were removed with a solid-phase extraction  alumina-basic column and the eluates were directly analyzed on an ODS column (250x4.6 mm, 5 microm) with acetonitrile-0.01 M acetate buffer (pH 4.6) as eluent. UV detection of CLOP and the 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide portion of NICA was  carried out at 265 and 345 nm, respectively. The mean recovery from NICA spiked samples was 95% with a RSD of 4% in a concentration range of 2-150 mg/kg while for CLOP it was 98% with a RSD of 5% in a concentration range of 5-150 mg/kg. The limits of detection of NICA and CLOP in feed, based on a detector signal-to-noise ratio of 3, were estimated to be 1 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively, and the lowest levels tested in feeds by this procedure were 2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively.  	10895934

Author information:  (1)Department of Virology, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lomburdia  e dell'Emilia, Brescia, Italy.  A serological survey of 238 rabbits for antirabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) antibodies was made in an industrial rabbitry where no signs of the disease had been reported for four years. Seroconversion was repeatedly detected  and was due to a calicivirus antigenically related to RHDV but without its pathogenicity. There was a seroprevalence of 33.3 per cent among young animals at weaning at 31 days old, 27.6 per cent at five to seven days after weaning, 56.1 per cent at 13 to 14 days after weaning, 90.3 per cent at 19 to 20 days and 100 per cent at 32 to 33 days after weaning, and all the breeding rabbits were seropositive. In the last group and in the young at weaning, the anti-RHDV antibodies were mainly class IgG, but they were IgM and IgA at 13 to 14 days after weaning. In older fattening rabbits, there was a decrease of IgM and IgA and an increase of IgG confirmed seroconversion without any specific signs of rabbit haemorrhagic disease. On the basis of these results, the probable time of  infection of the meat rabbits with this non-pathogenic virus was immediately after weaning.  	9226848

Author information:  (1)Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e della Emilia, Brescia, Italy.  The lapinized chinese (LC) strain of hog cholera virus (HCV), was adapted to grow in a cell line from minipig kidney (MPK) where it reached a titer, as determined  by immunofluorescence, significantly higher than in rabbits. Inasmuch as the immune serum to HCV neutralized the culture-adapted virus, it was concluded that  its antigenicity did not undergo any change after adaptation to MPK cells. The MPK-LC adapted virus (MPK-LC-HCV) showed also a higher immunogenic activity in rabbits, in comparison with the original LC virus. The MPK-LC-HCV protected pigs  against challenge infection with virulent HCV. Thus, the vaccinated pigs did not  show any clinical signs of disease, nor have they been responsible of virus shedding after they were exposed to the challenge infection 1 month or 6 and 11 months later. All vaccinated pigs seroconverted after vaccination and the antibody titers were on the same range of those reported in pigs vaccinated with  the traditional vaccine prepared in rabbits. In the same pigs the antibody concentration underwent a booster effect following challenge infection. It was suggested the MPK-LC-HCV vaccine as an alternative product that might be used to  prevent HCV infection. prevent HCV infection.  	1516363
